	abstract = {It has been approximately 100 years since the very first formal experimental evaluations of statistical charts were conducted. In that time, technological changes have impacted both our charts and our testing methods, resulting in a dizzying array of charts, many different taxonomies to classify graphics, and several different philosophical approaches to testing the efficacy of charts and graphs experimentally. Once rare, charts and graphical displays are now everywhere—but do they help us understand? In this article we review the history of graphical testing across disciplines, discuss different direct approaches to testing graphics, and contrast direct tests with visual inference, which requires that the viewer determine both the question and the answer. Examining the past 100 years of graphical testing, we summarize best practices for creating effective graphics and discuss what the future holds for graphics and empirical testing of interactive statistical visualizations.},

Data sharing is now required by funders and publishers and is becoming a disciplinary expectation in many fields. However, practices promoting data reusability and research transparency are poorly understood, making it difficult for statisticians and other researchers to reframe study methods to facilitate data sharing. This article reviews the larger landscape of open research and describes contextual information that data reusers need to understand, evaluate, and appropriately analyze shared data. The article connects data reusability to statistical thinking by considering the impact of the type and quality of shared research artifacts on the capacity to reproduce or replicate studies and examining quality evaluation frameworks to understand the nature of data errors and how they can be mitigated prior to sharing. Actions statisticians can take to update their research approaches for their own and collaborative investigations are suggested.},

This article attempts to bring much-needed order. First, we explicate the various choices and assumptions made—often implicitly—to justify the use of prediction-based decision-making. Next, we show how such choices and assumptions can raise fairness concerns and we present a notationally consistent catalog of fairness definitions from the literature. In doing so, we offer a concise reference for thinking through the choices, assumptions, and fairness considerations of prediction-based decision-making.},

We consider dynamic extensions to these models to account for the evolution of competitor strengths over time. Full likelihood-based analyses of these time-varying models can be simplified into rating systems, such as the Elo and Glicko rating systems. We present other modern rating systems, including popular methods for online gaming, and novel systems that have been implemented for online chess and Go. The discussion of the analytic methods are accompanied by examples of where these approaches have been implemented for various gaming organizations, as well as a detailed application to National Basketball Association game outcomes.},

Having such a vague characterization of a field in the early stages might be natural, but over time maintaining such a broad definition becomes unwieldy and impedes progress. In particular, the teaching of data science is hampered by the seeming need to cover many different points of interest. Data scientists must ultimately identify the core of the field by determining what makes the field unique and what it means to develop new knowledge in data science. In this review we attempt to distill some core ideas from data science by focusing on the iterative process of data analysis and develop some generalizations from past experience. Generalizations of this nature could form the basis of a theory of data science and would serve to unify and scale the teaching of data science to large audiences.},

The extension to the case of time-dependent {ROC} curves for evaluating prognostic accuracy is also touched upon.

Related definitions, including missing completely at random, always {MAR}, always missing completely at random, and partially {MAR}, are also covered. I present a formal argument for weakening Rubin\&apos;s sufficient conditions for frequentist maximum likelihood inference with precision based on the observed information. Some simple examples of {MAR} are described, together with an example where the missingness mechanism can be ignored even though {MAR} does not hold. Alternative approaches to statistical inference based on the likelihood function are reviewed, along with non-likelihood frequentist approaches, including weighted generalized estimating equations. Connections with the causal inference literature are also discussed. Finally, alternatives to Rubin\&apos;s {MAR} definition are discussed, including informative missingness, informative censoring, and coarsening at random. The intent is to provide a relatively nontechnical discussion, although some of the underlying issues are challenging and touch on fundamental questions of statistical inference.},

	abstract = {Changes in the Earth\&apos;s climate have been increasingly observed. Assessing the likelihood that each of these changes has been caused by human influence is important for decision making on mitigation and adaptation policy. Because of their large societal and economic impacts, extreme events have garnered much media attention—have they become more frequent and more intense, and if so, why? To answer such questions, extreme event attribution ({EEA}) tries to estimate extreme event likelihoods under different scenarios. Over the past decade, statistical methods and experimental designs based on numerical models have been developed, tested, and applied. In this article, we review the basic probability schemes, inference techniques, and statistical hypotheses used in {EEA}. To implement {EEA} analysis, the climate community relies on the use of large ensembles of climate model runs. We discuss, from a statistical perspective, how extreme value theory could help to deal with the different modeling uncertainties. In terms of interpretation, we stress that causal counterfactual theory offers an elegant framework that clarifies the design of event attributions. Finally, we pinpoint some remaining statistical challenges, including the choice of the appropriate spatio-temporal scales to enhance attribution power, the modeling of concomitant extreme events in a multivariate context, and the coupling of multi-ensemble and observational uncertainties.},

It appears that misuse arises from various sources: degrees of competence in statistical theory and methods, honest error in the application of methods, egregious negligence, and deliberate deception (misconduct.) The incidence of error is partly due to a perceived need to meet artificial statistical criteria for acceptance of research reports for publication by journals. There has been no systematic research into the prevalence of misuse or its breakdown by type. Nonetheless, there are ways to encourage, or even to enforce, good statistical practice. These can be greatly supported by use of available statistical ethics documents.

By definition, insurance offers financial cover against unforeseen events that involve an important component of randomness, and consequently, probability theory and mathematical statistics enter insurance modeling in a fundamental way. In recent years, a data deluge, coupled with ever-advancing information technology and the birth of data science, has revolutionized or is about to revolutionize most areas of actuarial science as well as insurance practice. We discuss parts of this evolution and, in the case of non-life insurance, show how a combination of classical tools from statistics, such as generalized linear models and, e.g., neural networks contribute to better understanding and analysis of actuarial data. We further review areas of actuarial science where the cross fertilization between stochastics and insurance holds promise for both sides. Of course, the vastness of the field of insurance limits our choice of topics; we mainly focus on topics closer to our main areas of research.},

The experiment has been carried out with multiple plants, and each plant has shown attempts at mimicry. It was observed that mimic leaves showed altered leaf areas, perimeters, lengths, and widths compared to non-mimic leaves. We have calculated four morphometrical features and observed that mimic leaves showed higher aspect ratio and lower rectangularity and form factor compared to non-mimic leaves. In addition, we have observed differences in the leaf venation patterns, with the mimic leaves having less dense vascular networks, thinner vascular strands, and lower numbers of free-ending veinlets.},

	abstract = {Background
The mechanisms determining the laterality and the rotation direction of hair whorls are unknown. Here we report observations on twins investigating the genetic bases of whorl pattern formation. Knowing that vortex phenomena may depend on geographic effects, we also provide comparative data on whorls from children born in the Northern hemisphere (France) versus children born in the Southern hemisphere (Chile).
Material and methods
We retrospectively included children from three populations: (1) Northern hemisphere general population, (2) Southern hemisphere general population, and (3) same-sex Northern hemisphere twins. We recorded whorl rotation direction (clockwise, counterclockwise), whorl position (left, right, central) and twinning type. Univariate logistic models were used to screen for associations between rotation direction and whorl position. For twins, the variable of interest was binary, i.e. same rotation direction (reference class) or opposite directions for each twin pair. For controls, all single combinations were included as virtual twins, and compared to real twins. Odds ratios ({OR}) were compared for both hemispheres, for real twins and virtual (control) twins.
Results
Seventy-four (37 pairs) twins and 50 children from the general population of each hemisphere were included. The {OR} for opposite rotation directions between two twins was ≠1 (p = 0.017), meaning that whorls rotated preferentially in the same direction in twins. {ORs} were {\textless}1 for Northern and Southern hemispheres, meaning that whorls rotated preferentially in the same direction in simulated twins. {OR} for the Northern hemisphere (0.04 [0.03; 0.05]) was less than the {OR} for the Southern hemisphere (0.28 [0.24; 0.32]) with no confidence interval superimposition, indicating than counterclockwise whorls were more frequent in the Southern hemisphere (p {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions
We suggest that hair whorl formation is a genetically determined developmental process that can be influenced by extrinsic environmental factors. Our results furthermore underline the general importance of studies focused on limit phenomena that can provide insights on general developmental mechanisms. We plead for large-scale epidemiological assessments of hair whorls in several Northern and Southern hemisphere populations to confirm these surprising findings suggesting significant modulations of craniofacial development by geographic effects.},

	abstract = {Many people have flipped coins but few have stopped to ponder the statistical and physical intricacies of the process. In a preregistered study we collected 350,757 coin flips to test the counterintuitive prediction from a physics model of human coin tossing developed by Diaconis, Holmes, and Montgomery ({DHM}; 2007). The model asserts that when people flip an ordinary coin, it tends to land on the same side it started—{DHM} estimated the probability of a same-side outcome to be about 51\%. Our data lend strong support to this precise prediction: the coins landed on the same side more often than not, Pr(same side) = 0.508, 95\% credible interval ({CI}) [0.506, 0.509], {BFsame}-side bias = 2359. Furthermore, the data revealed considerable between-people variation in the degree of this same-side bias. Our data also confirmed the generic prediction that when people flip an ordinary coin—with the initial side-up randomly determined—it is equally likely to land heads or tails: Pr(heads) = 0.500, 95\% {CI} [0.498, 0.502], {BFheads}-tails bias = 0.182. Furthermore, this lack of heads-tails bias does not appear to vary across coins. Additional exploratory analyses revealed that the within-people same-side bias decreased as more coins were flipped, an effect that is consistent with the possibility that practice makes people flip coins in a less wobbly fashion. Our data therefore provide strong evidence that when some (but not all) people flip a fair coin, it tends to land on the same side it started. Our data provide compelling statistical support for the {DHM} physics model of coin tossing.},

	abstract = {The observation of individuals attaining remarkable ages, and their concentration into geographic 15 sub-regions or ‘blue zones’, has generated considerable scientific interest. Proposed drivers of remarkable longevity include high vegetable intake, strong social connections, and genetic markers. Here, we reveal new predictors of remarkable longevity and ‘supercentenarian’ status. In the United States, supercentenarian status is predicted by the absence of vital registration. The state-specific introduction of birth certificates is associated with a 69-82\% fall in the number of 20 supercentenarian records. In Italy, England, and France, which have more uniform vital registration, remarkable longevity is instead predicted by poverty, low per capita incomes, shorter life expectancy, higher crime rates, worse health, higher deprivation, fewer 90+ year olds, and residence in remote, overseas, and colonial territories. In England and France, higher old-age poverty rates alone predict more than half of the regional variation in attaining a remarkable age. 25 Only 18\% of ‘exhaustively’ validated supercentenarians have a birth certificate, falling to zero percent in the {USA}, and supercentenarian birthdates are concentrated on days divisible by five: a pattern indicative of widespread fraud and error. Finally, the designated ‘blue zones’ of Sardinia, Okinawa, and Ikaria corresponded to regions with low incomes, low literacy, high crime rate and short life expectancy relative to their national average. As such, relative poverty and short 30 lifespan constitute unexpected predictors of centenarian and supercentenarian status and support a primary role of fraud and error in generating remarkable human age records. {aCC}-{BY}-{NC}-{ND} 4.0 International license.},

The transport rate through the channel depends strongly on the degree of activity, an effect that we assign to the different distribution of conformations sampled by the worms depending on their activity. Our results demonstrate a unique way to sort mixtures of active polymers based on their activity and provide a versatile and convenient experimental system to investigate the hydrodynamics of active polymers.},

The results showed that students who had more misconceptions achieved poorer conceptual text comprehension and, at the same time, provided more overconfident predictions of their conceptual and procedural text comprehension than students who had fewer misconceptions.

To stimulate discussion of outmoded thinking regarding the conduct of research, I list six misconceptions about research that persist long after their flaws have become apparent. The misconceptions are: 1) There is a hierarchy of study designs; randomized trials provide the greatest validity, followed by cohort studies, with case–control studies being least reliable. 2) An essential element for valid generalization is that the study subjects constitute a representative sample of a target population. 3) If a term that denotes the product of two factors in a regression model is not statistically significant, then there is no biologic interaction between those factors. 4) When categorizing a continuous variable, a reasonable scheme for choosing category cut-points is to use percentile-defined boundaries, such as quartiles or quintiles of the distribution. 5) One should always report P values or confidence intervals that have been adjusted for multiple comparisons. 6) Significance testing is useful and important for the interpretation of data. These misconceptions have been perpetuated in journals, classrooms and textbooks. They persist because they represent intellectual shortcuts that avoid more thoughtful approaches to research problems. I hope that calling attention to these misconceptions will spark the debates needed to shelve these outmoded ideas for good.},

Participants repeatedly copied words until they felt “peculiar”, had completed the task, or had another reason to stop. About two-thirds of all participants (in about one-third of all trials) reported strange subjective experiences during the task. Participants reported feeling peculiar after about thirty repetitions, or one minute. We describe these experiences as jamais vu. This experimentally induced phenomenon was related to real-world experiences of unfamiliarity. Although we replicated known patterns of correlations with déjà vu (age and dissociative experiences), the same pattern was not found for our experimental analogue of jamais vu, suggesting some differences between the two phenomena. However, in daily life, those people who had déjà vu more frequently also had jamais vu more frequently. Findings are discussed with reference to the progress that has been made in déjà vu research in recent years, with a view to fast-tracking our understanding of jamais vu.},

Electric taste is the sensation elicited upon stimulating the tongue with electric current. We used this phenomenon to convey information that humans cannot perceive with their tongue. Our method involves changing the taste of foods and drinks by using electric taste. First, we propose a system to drink beverages using straws that are connected to an electric circuit. Second, we propose a system to eat foods using a fork or chopsticks connected to an electric circuit. Finally, we discuss augmented gustation using various sensors.},

	abstract = {Background Boredom is a common complaint among students. Boredom was previously found to be negatively associated with academic outcomes, such as academic motivation, strategies, and achievement. It is of interest to understand students’ in-class boredom, especially factors that might exacerbate it. Aims The current study examines the influence of teacher's boredom on students’ in-class boredom and learning experience. It aims to understand the relationship between teacher boredom, students’ perceived teacher boredom, student boredom, and student learning motivation. Sample A total of 437 students (54.8\% female, {MAge} = 14.5 years, {SD} = 1.6) and 17 of their teachers (29.4\% female, 76.5\% 40 years old or below) participated in the study. Methods We conducted an experience sampling study, in which participants completed a 2-week diary. Data were analysed using multilevel modelling. Results and Conclusions Results from multilevel modelling of 2,675 post-class evaluations indicated that teacher boredom was negatively associated with students’ motivation. However, the relationship between teacher boredom and students’ perceived teacher boredom was not significant, suggesting that students did not accurately perceive whether their teacher was bored. Results from indirect effect analysis further revealed that students’ perception of teacher boredom predicted student learning motivation through student boredom. In other words, perceiving teachers being bored promoted students’ own feeling of boredom, which in turn reduced their learning motivation. Together, these results indicate that when a teacher is bored in class, or when students perceive that their teacher is bored, students would have lower learning motivation.},

	abstract = {Many data visualization experts recommend the use of bar charts over pie charts because they consider comparing the area or angle of segments to be less accurate than comparing bars on a bar chart. However, many studies show that when the pie chart is used to estimate proportions (arguably its main function) it is as accurate as the bar chart. A major issue is that most previous studies have only looked at one method of extracting information from pie charts, for example either by comparing the segment to the circle (the part-whole relationship) or one segment to another (relative magnitude estimation). Therefore, in this study I test multiple metrics to provide a more holistic assessment of the pie and donut chart against the bar chart. I also measured cognitive load through pupillometry. In summary, bar charts were more precise than pie and donut charts for ranking elements, but all charts were equally accurate for extracting the part-whole relationship. There was little difference in cognitive load between chart types, although bar charts were consistently faster to use on average. Overall, the bar chart was more flexible, but where there were statistically significant differences between charts, the effect sizes were often small, and unlikely to prevent effective extraction of quantitative information. That is, as long as they were used appropriately, all chart types were arguably acceptable for displaying simple, categorical data.},

	abstract = {This paper evaluates the ethics behind the actions of Facebook leading up to and after the joint Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal that involved the 2016 Presidential Candidate Donald Trump. Facebook, Inc. is a massive tech conglomerate, most commonly known for its social media platform Facebook, as well as its ownership of Instagram, Messenger, and Whatsapp. Cambridge Analytica was a political consulting firm that specialized in leveraging data mining techniques in order to help their clients expand potential voter bases. The scandal involved Cambridge Analytica’s exploitation of the raw data of over 87 million Facebook profiles that Facebook negligently protected. The scandal occurred privately from 2013 to 2016, with news finally breaking to the public in March of 2018 when a former Cambridge Analytica employee, Christopher Wylie, blew the whistle to the Guardian and the New York Times. This paper shows where the ethical breakdowns occured within Facebook and explores the company’s responsibility in relation to the scandal. Facebook repeatedly violated their own Code of Conduct and their own Data Policies when they became lax with the handling of user data in respect to 3rd parties. This scandal began a global discussion on protecting the public from the weaponization of private consumer data as well as exploring the need for potential regulations on Big Tech.},

Death rates increased with amount of cigarette smoking and degree of inhalation. 3) Death rates from the following diseases were much higher in cigarette smokers than in nonsmokers: cancer of the lung, buccal cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, bladder, and pancreas; gastric ulcer; emphysema; and aortic aneurysm. Coronary artery disease death rates were highly related to cigarette smoking among men in the middle-age groups but less highly related among men in the old-age groups. In age group 40–59, the coronary artery disease death rate was 1.95 times as high among light cigarette smokers as among nonsmokers and 3.00 times as high among heavy cigarette smokers as among nonsmokers. 4) Death rates of cigarette smokers and nonsmokers were studied in relation to many other factors, such as longevity of parents and grandparents, cancer in parents and siblings, height, exercise, sleep, race, religion, education, marital status, nervous tension, and prior history of certain diseases. Within every group studied, the death rate of men who smoked 20 or more cigarettes a day was considerably higher than that of nonsmokers. 5) Nonsmokers were matched individually with men who smoked 20 or more cigarettes per day, the 2 men in each matched pair being similar in age, height, race, nativity, religion, marital status, residence (urban or rural), certain occupational exposures, education, drinking habits, nervous tension, use of tranquilizers, sleep, exercise, health at time of enrollment, and past history of cancer, heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure. Altogether 36,975 such pairs were found. During the study, 1,385 of the 36,975 cigarette smokers died, while only 662 of the nonsmokers died. Of the cigarette smokers, 110 died with lung cancer and 654 with coronary artery disease, while, of the nonsmokers, 12 died with lung cancer and 304 with coronary artery disease. Emphysema caused the death of 15 cigarette smokers but only 2 nonsmokers. 6) The proportion of men hospitalized during the first 2 years of the study was considerably higher among cigarette smokers than among nonsmokers and increased with amount of cigarette smoking and degree of inhalation.},

Among 246 corresponding monozygotic male pairs, the numbers were 18 vs 18. For women, the numbers were 42 vs 31 among 781 dizygotic pairs, and 14 vs 13 among 326 monozygotic pairs. The hypermortality was mainly due to coronary heart disease, lung cancer, suicides, and accidents. Nonsmokers were registered at 10\% in a nationwide “alcohol registry” as against 30\% for high smokers. The mortality among the registered subjects was significantly higher than among the nonregistered, regardless of smoking.

Previously, we found that the marginal value of food for Egyptian fruit bats, Rousettus aegyptiacus, decreases when its ethanol content exceeds 1\%. Therefore, we hypothesized that, if ingested, food containing {\textgreater}1\% ethanol is toxic to these bats, probably causing inebriation that will affect flight and echolocation skills. We tested this hypothesis by flying Egyptian fruit bats in an indoor corridor and found that after ingesting ethanol-rich food bats flew significantly slower than when fed ethanol-free food. Also, the ingestion of ethanol significantly affected several variables of the bats’ echolocation calls and behavior. We concluded that ethanol can be toxic to fruit bats; not only does it reduce the marginal value of food, but it also has negative physiological effects on their ability to fly competently and on their calling ability.},

	abstract = {Experimental and comparative studies suggest that the striped coats of zebras can prevent biting fly attacks. Biting flies are serious pests of livestock that cause economic losses in animal production. We hypothesized that cows painted with black and white stripes on their body could avoid biting fly attacks and show fewer fly-repelling behaviors. Six Japanese Black cows were assigned to treatments using a 3 × 3 Latin-square design. The treatments were black-and-white painted stripes, black painted stripes, and no stripes (all-black body surface). Recorded fly-repelling behaviors were head throw, ear beat, leg stamp, skin twitch, and tail flick. Photo images of the right side of each cow were taken using a commercial digital camera after every observation and biting flies on the body and each leg were counted from the photo images. Here we show that the numbers of biting flies on Japanese Black cows painted with black-and-white stripes were significantly lower than those on non-painted cows and cows painted only with black stripes. The frequencies of fly-repelling behaviors in cows painted with black-and-white stripes were also lower than those in the non-painted and black-striped cows. These results thus suggest that painting black-and-white stripes on livestock such as cattle can prevent biting fly attacks and provide an alternative method of defending livestock against biting flies without using pesticides in animal production, thereby proposing a solution for the problem of pesticide resistance in the environment.},

	abstract = {Generalized additive models are generalized linear models in which the linear predictor includes a sum of smooth functions of covariates, where the shape of the functions is to be estimated. They have also been generalized beyond the original generalized linear model setting to distributions outside the exponential family and to situations in which multiple parameters of the response distribution may depend on sums of smooth functions of covariates. The widely used computational and inferential framework in which the smooth terms are represented as latent Gaussian processes, splines, or Gaussian random effects is reviewed, paying particular attention to the case in which computational and theoretical tractability is obtained by prior rank reduction of the model terms. An empirical Bayes approach is taken, and its relatively good frequentist performance discussed, along with some more overtly frequentist approaches to model selection. Estimation of the degree of smoothness of component functions via cross validation or marginal likelihood is covered, alongside the computational strategies required in practice, including when data and models are reasonably large. It is briefly shown how the framework extends easily to location-scale modeling, and, with more effort, to techniques such as quantile regression. Also covered are the main classes of smooths of multiple covariates that may be included in models: isotropic splines and tensor product smooth interaction terms.},

	abstract = {Infectious diseases pose a persistent challenge to public health worldwide. Recent global health crises, such as the {COVID}-19 pandemic and Ebola outbreaks, have underscored the vital role of infectious disease modeling in guiding public health policy and response. Infectious disease modeling is a critical tool for society, informing risk mitigation measures, prompting timely interventions, and aiding preparedness for healthcare delivery systems. This article synthesizes the current landscape of infectious disease modeling, emphasizing the integration of statistical methods in understanding and predicting the spread of infectious diseases. We begin by examining the historical context and the foundational models that have shaped the field, such as the {SIR} (susceptible, infectious, recovered) and {SEIR} (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) models. Subsequently, we delve into the methodological innovations that have arisen, including stochastic modeling, network-based approaches, and the use of big data analytics. We also explore the integration of machine learning techniques in enhancing model accuracy and responsiveness. The review identifies the challenges of parameter estimation, model validation, and the incorporation of real-time data streams. Moreover, we discuss the ethical implications of modeling, such as privacy concerns and the communication of risk. The article concludes by discussing future directions for research, highlighting the need for data integration and interdisciplinary collaboration for advancing infectious disease modeling.},

Although differential privacy originated in the cryptographic context, in this review we argue that, fundamentally, it can be considered a pure statistical concept. We leverage Blackwell’s informativeness theorem and focus on demonstrating based on prior work that all definitions of differential privacy can be formally motivated from a hypothesis testing perspective, thereby showing that hypothesis testing is not merely convenient but also the right language for reasoning about differential privacy. This insight leads to the definition of f-differential privacy, which extends other differential privacy definitions through a representation theorem. We review techniques that render f-differential privacy a unified framework for analyzing privacy bounds in data analysis and machine learning. Applications of this differential privacy definition to private deep learning, private convex optimization, shuffled mechanisms, and {US} Census data are discussed to highlight the benefits of analyzing privacy bounds under this framework compared with existing alternatives.},

Unfortunately, finding variables that satisfy conditions b or c can be challenging in practice. This article reviews works where instruments may not satisfy conditions b or c, which we refer to as invalid instruments.

	abstract = {Correlated data occur naturally and frequently in small and big data, and methods for analyzing correlated data have seen great advances in recent decades. Attention to design issues typically lags behind that paid to estimation issues, and it is also true that construction of optimal designs for models with correlated data lags that for models with uncorrelated data. A key problem in constructing optimal designs for models with correlated observations is that more technical assumptions are needed than when models have uncorrelated errors. In the former case, approximations to the information matrix are needed, and there are also no general and effective algorithms for finding various types of optimal designs. In addition, there are no tools to confirm optimality of a design. This article first gives a short review of optimal designs for linear models, before we focus on a review of finding optimal designs for models with correlated data. We discuss various approaches and their difficulties in a few selected areas. Along the way, we provide examples and recommend use of nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms to find all kinds of optimal designs for any criterion or model with or without correlated data.},

A major challenge in this field is handling censored data, particularly partly intervalcensored data, where event times are either precisely recorded or only known to fall within a specific interval. Proper statistical modeling of such data is crucial for drawing valid conclusions and making accurate predictions. This article reviews regression models for analyzing interval-censored responses and their implementation in R. Following an introduction to the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator, we focus on four major regression models: the accelerated failure time model, the proportional hazards model, the proportional odds model, and the generalized odds-rate model. For each, we review the state of the art, outline its methodology, discuss implementation strategies, and illustrate practical applications using real-world data.

There are several newer statistical challenges that researchers have tried to tackle in recent years, such as modeling data streams collected at vastly different temporal resolutions from multiple devices to study animal behavior and incorporating physiological processes as drivers of animal movement.

(b) We then consider the estimation of discontinuity for functional process data. Many longitudinal or functional responses may exhibit abrupt jumps, and our methodology effectively accommodates such complicated nonsmooth features.

This framework demonstrates that community structures in networks can shift similarly to changes observed in time series data.

Furthermore, the direction of possible causation is considered to flow from narcissism to {SAI}. However, an intriguing question is whether the effect might be reciprocal, that is, whether the belief that one is intelligent facilitates the expression of narcissism. In the current study (N = 364), we investigated this issue by examining how two types of {IQ} feedback, (1) positive feedback ({IQ} is above average) and (2) negative feedback ({IQ} is below average), influenced {SAI} and a temporary state of narcissistic admiration. Our study revealed that positive {IQ} feedback correlated with increased people's {SAI} and one subscale of state narcissistic admiration: striving for uniqueness (i.e., the feeling of being special, bragging about one's abilities and enjoyment of one's successes). By contrast, negative {IQ} feedback was associated with decreased people's {SAI} and lower level of state narcissism. We conclude that {IQ} feedback may shape people's beliefs about their intelligence, and that lay concepts of intelligence might incorporate some narcissistic elements, such as the feeling of being uniquely special.},

The present study investigated the effects of garlic ingestion by the mother on the odor of her breast milk and the suckling behavior of her infant. Evaluation of the milk samples by a sensory panel revealed garlic ingestion significantly and consistently increased the perceived intensity of the milk odor; this increase in odor intensity was not apparent 1 hour after ingestion, peaked in strength 2 hours after ingestion, and decreased thereafter. That the nursling detected these changes in mother's milk is suggested by the finding that infants were attached to the breast for longer periods of time and sucked more when the milk smelled like garlic. There was a tendency for infants to ingest more milk as well; the lack of a significant effect may be due to the inherent limitations on the total amount of milk available to the infant.},

This can be achieved without increasing the calories of food by mixing food with a material that cannot be metabolized. Such a material should be inert, safe, resistant to stomach acid, lack taste, available in powder form, smooth, resistant to heat, and cost effective. Polytetrafluoroethylene ({PTFE}) is an ideal substance for this purpose. It is a soft plastic that is widely considered to be the most inert material known and is extremely stable. Animal feeding trials showed that rats fed a diet of 25\% {PTFE} for 90 days had no signs of toxicity and that the rats lost weight. This article publishes the data from these subchronic animal feeding trials, reviews the relevant available literature, and hypothesizes that increasing the volume of food by mixing the food with {PTFE} powder at a ratio of 3 parts food to 1 part {PTFE} by volume will substantially improve satiety and reduce caloric consumption in people.},

Following the experimental manipulation, participants took part in a standardized discussion in Dutch with a blinded experimenter. The discussion was audio-recorded and foreign language skills were subsequently rated by two native Dutch speakers who were blind to the experimental condition (observer-rating). Participants also rated their own individual Dutch language skills during the discussion (self-rating).Results: Participants who consumed alcohol had significantly better observer-ratings for their Dutch language, specifically better pronunciation, compared with those who did not consume alcohol.

In addition to physical features, a choreography of movements, physical reactions and subtle expressions may help promote attraction. Here, we measured the physiological dynamics between pairs of participants during real-life dating interactions outside the laboratory. Participants wore eye-tracking glasses with embedded cameras and devices to measure physiological signals including heart rate and skin conductance. We found that overt signals such as smiles, laughter, eye gaze or the mimicry of those signals were not significantly associated with attraction. Instead, attraction was predicted by synchrony in heart rate and skin conductance between partners, which are covert, unconscious and difficult to regulate. Our findings suggest that interacting partners’ attraction increases and decreases as their subconscious arousal levels rise and fall in synchrony.},

	abstract = {In many taxa, individuals voluntarily detach a body part as a form to increase their chances of escaping predation. This defense mechanism, known as autotomy, has several consequences, such as changes in locomotor performance that may affect fitness. Scorpions of the genus Ananteris autotomize the “tail”, which in fact corresponds to the last abdominal segments. After autotomy, individuals lose nearly 25\% of their body mass and the last portion of the digestive tract, including the anus, which prevents defecation and leads to constipation, because regeneration does not occur. Here, we experimentally investigated the short- and long-term effects of tail loss on the locomotor performance of Ananteris balzani. In a short-term experiment, the maximum running speed ({MRS}) of males and females did not change after autotomy. Moreover, the relative mass of the lost tail did not affect the change in {MRS} after autotomy. In a long-term experiment, autotomy had a negative effect on the {MRS} of males, but not of females. Autotomized over-fed individuals suffered from severe constipation but were not slower than autotomized normally fed individuals. In conclusion, tail loss has no immediate effect on the locomotor performance of scorpions. The long-term decrease in the locomotor performance of autotomized males may impair mate searching. However, because death by constipation takes several months, males have a long time to find mates and reproduce. Thus, the prolonged period between autotomy and death by constipation is crucial for understanding the evolution of one of the most extreme cases of autotomy in nature.},

	abstract = {Oral mucositis ({OM}) is one of the most frequent adverse events of high-dose conditioning chemotherapy with melphalan prior to autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ({AHSCT}). It significantly reduces the patients’ quality of life. One of the preventive strategies for {OM} is cryotherapy. We retrospectively analyzed whether commercially available ice-cream could prevent {OM} during the melphalan infusion. We retrospectively analyzed 74 patients after {AHSCT} to see whether there is any correlation between {OM} and cryotherapy (ice-cream), melphalan dose (140 mg/m2 or 200 mg/m2). The incidence of {OM} in our study inversely correlated with cryotherapy in the form of ice-cream. Out of 74 patients receiving conditioning chemotherapy with high-dose melphalan, 52 received cryotherapy. Fifteen patients in the cryotherapy group (28.84\%) developed {OM}, whereas 13 patients (59.09\%) developed it in the group without cryotherapy. In a multiple linear regression test cryotherapy remained a significant protective factor against {OM} (p = 0.02) We have also seen the relationship between melphalan dose with {OM} (p {\textless} 0.005). Cryotherapy in the form of ice-cream is associated with a lower rate of {OM} and, therefore, could potentially be used as a cost-effective, less burdensome, and easy to implement method in prevention of oral mucositis.},

	abstract = {While the physiological response of humans to emotional events or stimuli is well-investigated for many modalities (like {EEG}, skin resistance, ...), surprisingly little is known about the exhalation of so-called Volatile Organic Compounds ({VOCs}) at quite low concentrations in response to such stimuli. {VOCs} are molecules of relatively small mass that quickly evaporate or sublimate and can be detected in the air that surrounds us. The paper introduces a new field of application for data mining, where trace gas responses of people reacting on-line to films shown in cinemas (or movie theaters) are related to the semantic content of the films themselves. To do so, we measured the {VOCs} from a movie theater over a whole month in intervals of thirty seconds, and annotated the screened films by a controlled vocabulary compiled from multiple sources. To gain a better understanding of the data and to reveal unknown relationships, we have built prediction models for so-called forward prediction (the prediction of future {VOCs} from the past), backward prediction (the prediction of past scene labels from future {VOCs}), which is some form of abductive reasoning, and Granger causality. Experimental results show that some {VOCs} and some labels can be predicted with relatively low error, and that hint for causality with low p-values can be detected in the data. The data set is publicly available at: https://github.com/jorro/smelloffear.},

	abstract = {Objectives:This study was conducted to examine the impact of sexual activity on nasal breathing and compare such effect to that of a nasal decongestant.Methods:We evaluated nasal breathing at 5 different times: (1) before sexual activity (baseline), (2) immediately after sexual activity, (3) 30 minutes, (4) 1 hour (5), and 3 hours after sexual climax. Same measurements were taken on the second day following application of nasal decongestant spray. For evaluation of nasal breathing, we used a visual analogue scale ({VAS}). Additionally, we used a portable rhinometric device to measure resistance and nasal flow.Results:Nasal breathing improved significantly after sexual intercourse with climax to the same degree as after application of nasal decongestant for up to 60 minutes, as measured subjectively with the {VAS} (sex −3.6, P {\textless} .001; spray −3.2, P {\textless} .001). This was confirmed in the objective rhinometric data as mean nasal flow ({mL}/s) increased while resistance decreased immediately (flow sex +214, P {\textless} .001; flow spray +235, P {\textless} .001), 30 (flow sex +249, P {\textless} .001; flow spray +287, P {\textless} .001), and 60 minutes (flow sex +180, P {\textless} .001; flow spray +287, P {\textless} .001) post-intervention. Nasal breathing was back to the baseline level after 3 hours following sexual intercourse, while it continued to be improved for longer after application of nasal decongestant. Only participants having nasal obstruction (Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation score {\textgreater}30) showed nasal function improvement after sex.Conclusions:Sexual intercourse with climax can improve nasal breathing to the same degree as application of nasal decongestant for up to 60 minutes in patients having nasal obstruction.},

	abstract = {Because facial hair is one of the most sexually dimorphic features of humans (Homo sapiens) and is often perceived as an indicator of masculinity and social dominance, human facial hair has been suggested to play a role in male contest competition. Some authors have proposed that the beard may function similar to the long hair of a lion’s mane, serving to protect vital areas like the throat and jaw from lethal attacks. This is consistent with the observation that the mandible, which is superficially covered by the beard, is one of the most commonly fractured facial bones in interpersonal violence. We hypothesized that beards protect the skin and bones of the face when human males fight by absorbing and dispersing the energy of a blunt impact. We tested this hypothesis by measuring impact force and energy absorbed by a fiber epoxy composite, which served as a bone analog, when it was covered with skin that had thick hair (referred to here as “furred”) versus skin with no hair (referred to here as “sheared” and “plucked”). We covered the epoxy composite with segments of skin dissected from domestic sheep (Ovis aries), and used a drop weight impact tester affixed with a load cell to collect force versus time data. Tissue samples were prepared in three conditions: furred (n = 20), plucked (n = 20), and sheared (n = 20). We found that fully furred samples were capable of absorbing more energy than plucked and sheared samples. For example, peak force was 16\% greater and total energy absorbed was 37\% greater in the furred compared to the plucked samples. These differences were due in part to a longer time frame of force delivery in the furred samples. These data support the hypothesis that human beards protect vulnerable regions of the facial skeleton from damaging strikes.},

	abstract = {Romantic mouth-to-mouth kissing is culturally widespread, although not a human universal, and may play a functional role in assessing partner health and maintaining long-term pair bonds. Use and appreciation of kissing may therefore vary according to whether the environment places a premium on good health and partner investment. Here, we test for cultural variation (13 countries from six continents) in these behaviours/attitudes according to national health (historical pathogen prevalence) and both absolute ({GDP}) and relative wealth ({GINI}). Our data reveal that kissing is valued more in established relationships than it is valued during courtship. Also, consistent with the pair bonding hypothesis of the function of romantic kissing, relative poverty (income inequality) predicts frequency of kissing across romantic relationships. When aggregated, the predicted relationship between income inequality and kissing frequency (r = 0.67, {BCa} 95\% {CI}[0.32,0.89]) was over five times the size of the null correlations between income inequality and frequency of hugging/cuddling and sex. As social complexity requires monitoring resource competition among large groups and predicts kissing prevalence in remote societies, this gesture may be important in the maintenance of long-term pair bonds in specific environments.},

Common methods of fitting trends by eye involve maneuvering a string, black thread, or ruler until the fit is suitable, then drawing the line through the set of points. In 2015, the New York Times introduced an interactive feature, called “You Draw It,” where readers were asked to input their own assumptions about various metrics and compare how these assumptions relate to reality. In this article, we validate “You Draw It” as a method for graphical testing, comparing results to the less technological method used in Mosteller et al. and extending that study with formal statistical analysis methods. Results were consistent with those found in the previous study; when shown points following a linear trend, participants tended to fit the slope of the principal axis over the slope of the least-squares regression line. This trend was most prominent when shown data simulated with larger variances. This study reinforces the differences between intuitive visual model fitting and statistical model fitting, providing information about human perception as it relates to the use of statistical graphics.
