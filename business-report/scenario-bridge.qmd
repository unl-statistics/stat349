title: "London Bridge is Falling Down"
---

Scenario Description:

You are an analyst for the Omaha, NE city government. 
The mayor, concerned about the degrading transportation infrastructure in the city, has asked you to assess the risk of bridge failure to the city, after well-publicized bridge collapses in cities on the East Coast in 2024. 

Assemble data from one or more reputable sources (State and national DOT, Army Corps of Engineers, etc.). 
Assess the risk of a bridge collapse event occurring over the next 5 years, using publicly available data. 
You should consider both the probability of such a collapse and the consequences -- a small county road bridge collapse is less problematic than e.g. the I-80 bridge over the Missouri collapsing.
What interventions do you recommend to minimize the risk?
