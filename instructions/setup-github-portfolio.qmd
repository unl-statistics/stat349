title: "Setting Up a Github.io portfolio"
---

# Steps

1.  Create a github repository that is named "portfolio" and located at `https://github.com/username/portfolio` (where username is your github username). 

2.  Create a quarto website (I recommend a blog – it will make it easier to keep track of when things are updated) by following [these directions](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html).

3. Change the build directory in `_quarto.yml` to `docs`

4. Build the default site (customize it later) with Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + B.


5. Add the files to git, including the /docs folder. Push your site (along with the `/docs` folder containing the rendered site) to GitHub. You can customize it later.

6.  On GitHub, set your site to render to the docs directory ([detailed instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html)).

    -   [ ] Create an empty `.nojekyll` file in the main directory of your project repository
    -   [ ] Configure your GitHub repository (Settings -\> Pages -\> Build and Deployment) to publish the `/docs` directory of the `main` branch of your repository.
    
7. Check the rendered site (it should have an address of https://<username>.github.io/portfolio) -- it may take ~5 minutes to appear after you've completed step 4.

8. Make any tweaks to your site that you'd like to make -- add pictures, a biography, posts about your interests, etc.
    - The goal of this is to have a place where you can showcase your coursework for future employers. Keep it professional (but it's ok to have some information about your hobbies, if you want to show that dimension of yourself). 
    - The department may eventually want to showcase some of these sites so that incoming students can see what current students accomplish as part of our courses. We will ask permission first!


# Updating your site

Rendering your site will be done manually -- thus, each time you want to update the actual site, you'll have to run the following commands in the **terminal** (not the R console):

```         
quarto render # Can also be accomplished by Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + B
git add docs
git commit -m "Publish site to docs/"
git push
```

(You can also accomplish this by hitting the Render button in RStudio and then adding and committing the docs folder in the git pane in RStudio.)

If you're feeling fancy, you can [automate this process using a GitHub action](https://thedatasavvycorner.com/blogs/03-quarto-github-actions), but this is fiddly and probably not worth it unless you're actually planning to use this as a blog and update it frequently. 
If you decide to set everything up with Github Actions, I can offer a minimal amount of help with debugging, but even I find them confusing.

### Rendering your site

Updating the markdown files is not enough -- you have to **render** (in e.g. RStudio) and **push the docs folder** for changes to show up on Github pages.

If things aren't working, 

- Run render via RStudio or by using `quarto render .` on the command line (in the project folder). 
- Look for any un-pushed changes, either in the Git pane of RStudio (hit refresh) or by running `git status` on the command line. 
- Check that the `docs/` folder has been committed AND pushed to GitHub.
- Ask for help, either in class during some downtime, or by making an office hours appointment.
