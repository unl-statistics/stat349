To test whether zebra stripes prevent biting fly attacks,
@kojimaCowsPaintedZebralike2019 painted cows with black-and-white,
black-only, and no stripes and recorded the number of fly repelling behaviors
and flies on the body and legs.

To test how Egyptian fruit bats are affected by ethanol (which occurs
naturally in fruit), researchers gave Egyptian fruit bats ethanol-rich and
ethanol-free food, finding that flight speed, echolocation calls, and
behavior were negatively impacted by the presence of ethanol
(@sanchezEthanolIngestionAffects2010).
