You should consider both the probability of a coastal -&gt; inland tornadic event and the consequences – a F0 tornado is unlikely to have the power to lift sharks from the water, while an F5 tornado might have the ability to transport many sharks inland.

Your safety officer recently read this article about office injury statistics and wants you to evaluate whether the company needs to implement stronger safety policies for office workers, as they are more likely to be injured through falls than non-office workers.\nAssemble data from one or more reputable sources (Bureau of Labor Statistics, Centers for Disease Control, Occupational Safety and Health Administration) to assess the risk of on-the-job injury for office and non-office workers. Consider both the severity of the injury and the probability of occurrence."

    "text": "Assignment Flow\nThis project is set up to scaffold this user guide and set you up for success.\nStart at topic.qmd and identify a topic for your user guide.\nOnce you’ve proposed a topic and received my approval/feedback, you can convert the contents of topic.qmd into an introductory paragraph in your report. Please leave the topic.qmd file as an appendix, to document the different stages of this project.\nOnce we’ve agreed on a topic for your user guide, you will proceed to needs.qmd and task-analysis.qmd. Both will be submitted at the same check-in, and both will be included in your final report as appendices. You should be able to re-purpose most of the information in task-analysis.qmd to orient the user to different components of the task you’ve chosen.\nYour next step is to actually write the content that satisfies the work you outlined in task-analysis.qmd.\nOnce you’re finished with that, ideally, you’ll have plenty of time to edit and streamline your report. Feel free to trade reports with a friend and try to complete your friend’s task - this will help you both identify areas where the guide isn’t as clear. Try to complete the task with a different data set - that often helps find trouble spots.\nWhen you submit your final report, you may remove index.qmd from the _quarto.yml file, which will remove this chapter (which is quite unnecessary for your user) from the report. You should also take the time to make sure your name is listed as both author and copyright holder in the _quarto.yml file. Feel free to make a custom cover for your manual if you would like to do so. You can also tweak the CSS/theme for the book, so long as you’re conscious of accessibility concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the report\n\n\n\nIf you are using RStudio to complete this report, you can hit (Ctrl/Cmd)-Shift-B to build the whole report. You can also type quarto render . on the command line in the project folder to accomplish the same thing.\nIf you have questions about how to customize or debug your book, it may be helpful to start at the quarto book documentation [@positpbcCreatingBook2024]."

    "text": "Kieran Healy “Fuck Nuance,” Sociological Theory 35, no. 2 (June 2017): 118–27, https://doi.org/10.1177/0735275117709046.\n\nSummary: Healy argues that nuance, a common (and praised) feature of sociological theory, inhibits abstraction and prevents the development of good theories. Nuance, in Healy’s argument, is the tendency to make theories more complicated by adding unnecessary complexity, rather than reducing complexity and making strong statements. Healy presents three ‘nuance traps’ which plague sociology and argues against it from multiple different perspectives.\nReliability assessment: The author is a professor of sociology at Duke University and has many different publications in the field. As a result, he is likely qualified to critique the field from an insider’s perspective. As this is just a template of an annotated bibliography and this article is unrelated to a review article, I cannot easily assess how this article relates to the review article or overall topic (but you should).\nMissing information:\n\nI do not understand sociology enough to have seen this tendency in the field (but it seems to apply well enough to statistics)\nThe aesthetic argument against nuance is a bit tricky to understand and may require reading up on Davis (1971) - what makes theory interesting. Healy argues that interesting is more important than truth (based on Davis) and that nuance can thus occasionally be interesting but is perhaps more often dull. Without being familiar with Davis, it is hard to know if I’m understanding this component of the argument."

    "text": "5.2 Course Components\n\n5.2.1 Reading Quizzes\nYou will have weekly reading assignments which introduce the weekly focus area and provide different perspectives on the material. Some of these perspectives will be covered in class lectures and activities, but some will not and are provided to expose you to different approaches and opinions.\nIn order to motivate the importance of doing the weekly reading before class, you will be given a weekly reading quiz on Canvas which covers the requisite material. These quizzes will be due before the first class of the week (so, at 10am on Mondays).\n\n\n5.2.2 Homework\nWeekly formative assignments (assignments meant to help you practice skills) will be given throughout the semester. The only way to learn the skills taught in this course is to practice - writing, citing, doing research, summarizing, and so on.\n\nYou will typically have one week to work on each of the assignments.\nAssignments must be submitted in the file format specified, and should run or compile as submitted for credit to be given.\nI will attempt to grade formative assignments within a week of the specified due date.\nFormative assessments may be resubmitted for partial credit subject to the terms of the resubmission policy below.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nLate assignments will be accepted only under extenuating circumstances, and only if you have contacted me prior to the assignment due date and received permission to hand the assignment in late. I reserve the right not to grade (or to assign a 0 to) any assignments received after the assignment due date.\nYou may submit an assignment that was not submitted in time as a resubmission, assuming it meets the conditions outlined in the next section.\n\n\nResubmission Policy\nLearning how to write is a process that requires an attempt and then subsequent improvement. Do not be afraid to make mistakes! I allow you to re-submit each formative/homework assignment once.\nNote: The resubmission policy does NOT apply to quizzes, projects, or exams.\nThis policy is subject to the following constraints:\n\nYou should resubmit assignments as soon as possible.\nYou may not resubmit an assignment for which solutions have been posted.\nEach assignment should be resubmitted only once.\nResubmissions are due no later than 2 weeks after the initial due date. In addition,\n\nResubmissions from weeks 1-7 must be submitted by Friday at 5pm of week 8 of classes\nResubmissions from weeks 8-14 must be submitted by Monday at 5pm of week 15 of classes\n\nResubmitted assignments will be graded at my convenience.\n\n\n\nI spend the extra time grading resubmissions because it reinforces your learning; this policy is not designed to improve your grade in this class.\nI reserve the right to adjust the resubmission policy over the course of the semester to ensure that it is meeting the objective of reinforcing your learning.\nI reserve the right to limit or penalize resubmissions if it becomes clear that the current policy does not promote learning of the material and/or support the course objectives.\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Attendance & Participation\nAll students are expected to attend and fully participate in class. Participation grades will be determined based on a combination of attendance and participation. Consistent, repeated failure to attend class or actively participate in the course will affect the participation portion of your grade.\nOne absence is allowed without any reduction in participation score - no excuse is necessary!\n\nIllness\nIf you are feeling ill, please do not come to class. Instead, review the material and work on the homework assignment, and then schedule an appointment with me to meet virtually. In the appointment reason field on Calendly, indicate that this appointment is to substitute for your in-class participation on the date you missed.\nIf you need to miss more than 1-2 classes for illness, I reserve the right to require documentation from Disability Services or a medical provider in order to continue using this substitute for attendance grades.\n\n\nInclement Weather\nIf in-person classes are canceled, you will be notified of the instructional continuity plan for this class by Canvas Announcement. In most circumstances where there is power in the Lincoln area, we will hold class via Zoom if the university cancels class. You will be held to the same participation standards on Zoom as you are in person, and participation and attendance will be graded accordingly, with some allowance for disruption at the individual level where circumstances warrant.\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Projects\nYou will complete two major projects in this course: a business-style report and presentation, and a user guide for a software package or implementation decision relating to a specific topic. The business report will include a presentation and will be compiled over the second half of the semester. The user guide is due just before Spring Break.\n\nLate Projects\nWriting is an iterative process that requires time - it’s good to write a draft and step away for a day before you revise it. As a result, projects in this course have been designed to encourage this iteration. You have at least 3 weeks to work on both projects outside of class.\nWith this in mind, late projects will not be accepted without evidence of severe, ongoing (&gt;1 week) extenuating circumstances of a severity that must be documented with your adviser and student services. In addition, to access an accommodation for late project work, you must provide a GitHub commit history that shows ongoing engagement with the project before the circumstance occurred. This policy is intended to discourage you from waiting until the last minute to complete your projects, as this does not allow you the time to practice iterative writing and revisions and builds bad writing habits.",

If you did not achieve this goal, then your answer is incomplete, regardless of whether or not it is technically correct. This is not to encourage you to add unnecessary complexity to your answer - simple, elegant solutions are always preferable to unwieldy, complex solutions that accomplish the same task.\nGrammar and spelling are important, as is your ability to communicate technical information clearly in a written format; both of these criteria will be used in addition to assignment-specific rubrics to evaluate your work.",

    "text": "5.5 Academic Integrity and Class Conduct\nYou will be engaging with your classmates and me through in-person discussions and collaborative activities. It is expected that everyone will engage in these interactions civilly and in good faith. Discussion and disagreement are important parts of the learning process, but it is important that mutual respect prevail. Individuals who detract from an atmosphere of civility and respect will be removed from the conversation or the classroom.\nStudents are expected to adhere to guidelines concerning academic dishonesty outlined in Article III B.1 of the University’s Student Code of Conduct. The Statistics Department academic integrity and grade appeal policy is available here.\n\n5.5.1 Code\nYou must be able to explain how the logic works for any code you turn in. This means that code you obtained from e.g. StackOverflow is fine to use if you can explain it and modify it for the purposes of this class, but if you cannot explain your code you will not get credit for the assignment. This is in line with what is generally considered acceptable behavior in programming - reuse is fine (subject to the code’s license) but you must be able to fully explain and modify any code you did not write yourself. You should also provide a link to the source of your code (or even the logic behind your code) - this is useful both for my information and for future you, in addition to being a good way to give attribution to the original author.\n\n\n5.5.2 Writing\nWith the proliferation of AI tools such as Chat-GPT, I reserve the right to replace project and homework grades with grades based on an oral discussion of your submissions. If you cannot explain the logic behind your submission, how you came to the approach you used, and identify the tradeoffs behind decisions you made, then you will not receive credit. Chat GPT can be a useful tool, but this course’s objectives are meant to assess your ability to communicate statistical information to a target audience effectively, not your ability to use AI systems. Fundamentally, you need to understand concepts and develop written fluency in technical language and statistical concepts to communicate effectively; generative AI solutions may hamper both of these goals if you rely on them too much.\n\n\n5.5.3 Generative AI\nTechnical writing is more clear and concise than other types of writing, and nuances are extremely important. To date, generative AI is not particularly good at these goals - it is wordy and uses nonstandard language, and as a predictive model, it cannot structure its output for human understanding. It may be useful to leverage AI tools to ensure that your work conforms to grammar and style guidelines, but I very highly discourage the use of generative AI for content.\nAny use of generative AI must be disclosed in an appendix to your submission - this includes brainstorming, editing, using AI as spell-check/grammar-check, and so on. You must document the following:\n\nthe version of the generative AI used\nthe full sequence of prompts and responses\nany additional inputs you provided to the AI system\na “diff” between the AI responses and your submission, showing exactly what was generated by the AI system and what you changed.",

Your colleagues will also be evaluating the same scenario, and your reports will be used in aggregate to determine a consensus (or lack thereof) on the company’s action. The reports will also be used to inform downsizing that is rumored to be coming - you want to ensure your report is better than your peers so that you aren’t as easy to cut.\nYou may talk to your peers who are assigned the same scenario, but you do not want to collaborate too closely, lest you both become targets of the rumored layoffs.\n\nI’ve scaffolded this report for you to make this process easier - as we talk about different sections of a report in class and read about how to create similar sections, you will practice by writing the equivalent section of your report.\nThe basic steps for this task are as follows:\n\nIdentify the research question from the business question\nIdentify data set(s) which are (1) publicly available (you don’t have a budget to pay for private data) and (2) relevant to your task\n\n(HW Week 6) Document your data sets in draft-data-doc.qmd\n\nConduct a statistical analysis to support your answer to your research and business questions\n\nWrite a methods section for your business report corresponding to your statistical analysis\n(HW Week 9) Draft of results section of business report with relevant graphics/visual aids in draft-results.qmd\n\nWrite your report\n\n(HW Week 10) Draft of Intro/Conclusion sections in draft-intro-conclusions.qmd\n(HW Week 11) Draft of Executive summary section in draft-exec-summary.qmd\n\nRevise your report\n\n(HW Week 12 – not turned in) Revise your report\n(HW Week 13) - Rough draft of report due. Create one or more qmd files for your report (you can overwrite or delete intro.qmd and summary.qmd), include the names of each file (in order) in _quarto.yml. You should use references (edit references.bib and use pandoc citations). Make sure your report compiles and looks reasonable in both html and pdf.\nDevelop a presentation to go along with your report (Week 13). Create slides for your report using quarto.\n\nPeer revise reports\n\nPeer revise reports\n(HW Week 14) - Make edits to your report from comments received from peer review\n\nFinal report & presentation due"

When the water temperature is above this point, the plant must operate at reduced capacity, as it cannot transfer additional thermal energy into the water.\nAssemble data from one or more reputable sources (USGS, NOAA, US Energy Information Administration). Make an operational assessment of the risk that the plant will have to operate at reduced capacity during the next 5 years.

You can customize it later.\nOn GitHub, set your site to render to the docs directory (detailed instructions).\n\nChange your _quarto.yml file to have output-dir: docs\nCreate an empty .nojekyll file in the main directory of your project repository\nConfigure your GitHub repository (Settings -&gt; Pages -&gt; Build and Deployment) to publish the /docs directory of the main branch of your repository.\n\nCheck the rendered site (it should have an address of https://.github.io/portfolio) – it may take ~5 minutes to appear after you’ve completed step 4.\nMake any tweaks to your site that you’d like to make – add pictures, a biography, posts about your interests, etc.\n\nThe goal of this is to have a place where you can showcase your coursework for future employers. Keep it professional (but it’s ok to have some information about your hobbies, if you want to show that dimension of yourself).\nThe department may eventually want to showcase some of these sites so that incoming students can see what current students accomplish as part of our courses. We will ask permission first!\n\n\n\n\nUpdating your site\nRendering your site will be done manually – thus, each time you want to update the actual site, you’ll have to run the following commands in the terminal (not the R console):\nquarto render\ngit add docs\ngit commit -m \"Publish site to docs/\"\ngit push\n(You can also accomplish this by hitting the Render button in RStudio and then adding and committing the docs folder in the git pane in RStudio.)\nIf you’re feeling fancy, you can automate this process using a GitHub action, but this is fiddly and probably not worth it unless you’re actually planning to use this as a blog and update it frequently. If you decide to set everything up with Github Actions, I can offer a minimal amount of help with debugging, but even I find them confusing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRendering your site\n\n\n\nUpdating the markdown files is not enough – you have to render (in e.g. RStudio) and push the docs folder for changes to show up on Github pages.\nIf things aren’t working,\n\nRun render via RStudio or by using quarto render . on the command line (in the project folder).\nLook for any un-pushed changes, either in the Git pane of RStudio (hit refresh) or by running git status on the command line.\nCheck that the docs/ folder has been committed AND pushed to GitHub.\nAsk for help, either in class during some downtime, or by making an office hours appointment."
