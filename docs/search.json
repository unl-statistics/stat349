To be clear, we are not implying that these correlational statements cause causal implicature, but rather that they are correlated with causal implicature. In other words, correlation does not imply causation, but it does sometimes “imply” causation."

    "text": "2.1 Trend Removal\nWilliam S. Cleveland and McGill (1984), W. S. Cleveland and McGill (1985) discuss the perceptual difficulty of judging the difference between two curves plotted in the same chart, and alternatively, recommend to display the difference between the two curves directly. This is in line with recommendations for good graphics to ‘show the data’ rather than make the reader derive some aspect of it (e.g. Wainer 2000).\nWhile the illusion is not apparent when trend line and variability in the residual structure are shown separately, the separation makes it more difficult to evaluate the overall pattern in the data, as we must base any judgment on two charts; either by combining information from two graphs or by mentally re-composing the original graph (at which point, the sine illusion becomes a factor). To minimize cognitive demands stemming from our limited visual memory (Healey and Enns 2012) we ideally want to tell the whole story with a single graph, in particular because in many situations we may not be able to show multiple graphs due to space limitations (such as in journal publications) or time and attention limitations (in presentations).\nAdditionally, removing the trend requires an initial model, making any plots produced using that fit conditional on the assumptions necessary to obtain that model fit. %In many situations, this may be undesirable. In particular, As we typically view the data before fitting even a rudimentary model, these initial modeling decisions might already be influenced by the sine illusion."

    "text": "2.2 Transformation of the \\(X\\)-Axis\nThe sine illusion is driven by changes in the slope of trends between variables, we can therefore counteract the illusion by removing these changes, transforming the \\(x\\) axis such that the absolute value of the slope is constant and forcing the corresponding orthogonal width to represent the conditional variability.\nLet us assume that the relationship between variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is given by a model of the form $ y = f(x) + $, where \\(f\\) is some underlying function (either previously known or based on a model fit), that is differentiable over the region of observed data.\nFor a correction, we want to find a transformation \\(T(x)\\) of \\(x\\), such that \\(f(T(x))\\) is a piece-wise linear function, where each piece has the same absolute slope. %This transformation has an effect similar to “banking to 45\\(^\\circ\\)” in a piecewise manner.\nLet \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) be the minimum and maximum of the \\(x\\)-range under consideration. Then for any value \\(x \\in (a,b)\\) the following transformation results in a function with constant absolute slope (see Section 8 for a derivation of the equation):\n\\[\n(f \\circ T)(x) = a + (b-a)\\left(\\int_{a}^x |f^\\prime(z)| dz\\right)/\\left(\\int_{a}^{b}|f^\\prime(z)| dz\\right),\n\\tag{1}\\]\nThe transformed \\(x\\)-axis is changed from a linear representation of the \\(x\\) values to a ‘warped’ axis that continuously changes the scale of \\(x\\) to compensate for changes in the slope. To emphasize this change in scale along the \\(x\\) axis, dots are drawn at the bottom of the chart to show the transformation’s effect on equally spaced points along the \\(x\\)-axis. Results from this transformation are demonstrated in Figure 6 (a).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) \\(X\\) axis transformation based on Equation 1, corresponding to weighting of \\(w=1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Weighted Transformation, \\(w=1/2\\) (based on Equation 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Weighted Transformation, \\(w=1/3\\) (based on Equation 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Weighted Transformation, \\(w=1/4\\) (based on Equation 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Examples of \\(X\\) axis transformations in the sine curve. Dots at the bottom of the graph show the transformation’s effect on equally spaced points along the \\(x\\)-axis. Different amounts of weighting \\(w\\) correspond to differently strong corrections. In (a), \\(x\\)-spacing of the lines changes the extant width such that the absolute value of the slope is uniform across the whole range of the \\(x\\) axis resulting in the largest amount of correction. (b) - (d) reduce the correction in (a) towards successively more uniform spacing in \\(x\\) while still breaking the effects of the illusion.\n\n\n\nWhile the transformation in Equation 1 effectively removes the appearance of changing line lengths, we can see in practice that the illusion can be broken by a much less severe transformation of the \\(x\\) axis. For that we introduce a shrinkage factor \\(w \\in (0,1)\\) that allows a weighted approach in counteracting the illusion as:\n\\[\n(f \\circ T_w)(x) = (1-w) \\cdot x + w \\cdot (f \\circ T)(x)\n\\tag{2}\\]\nNote that for \\(w=1\\) the \\(x\\)-transformation is applied completely, while smaller values of \\(w\\) indicate a less severe adjustment, %. Under weaker transformations, which lets the data more closely reflect the original function \\(f(x)\\). Figure 6 (b) - Figure 6 (d) show the effect of different shrinkage values \\(w\\). As \\(w\\) decreases, the lines become more evenly spaced and the illusion begins to return. The extent to which we can shrink the adjustment back to the original function varies with the aspect ratio of the chart and the function shape."

    "text": "2.3 Transformation in \\(Y\\)\nUnderstanding the geometry of the sine illusion leads to another approach of resolving the conflict between the orthogonal width and the vertical length of the segment.\nLet again the function \\(f\\) describe the general relationship between variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\nAs sketched out in Figure 7 (a) we want to first find the orthogonal (extant) width in a point \\((x_0, f(x_o))\\) on the graph, which corresponds to the perceived width, and then correct the vertical width accordingly to match with the audience’s expectation.\nThe orthogonal width (see sketch in Figure 7 (a)) is given as the line segment between endpoints \\((x_1, f_1(x_1))\\) and \\((x_2, f_2(x_2))\\), where \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_2\\) denote the vertical shifts of function \\(f\\) by \\(-\\ell/2\\) and \\(\\ell/2\\), respectively, where \\(\\ell\\) is defined as the overall line length, \\(\\ell &gt; 0, \\ell \\in \\xR\\). These endpoints are determined as the intersection of the line orthogonal to the tangent line in \\((x, f(x))\\) and graphs \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_2\\).\nThe orthogonal line through \\((x_o, f(x_o))\\) is given in point-vector form as \\[\n{x_o \\choose f(x_o)} + \\lambda {f^\\prime(x_o) \\choose 1},\n\\]\nfor any real-valued \\(\\lambda\\). The extant (half-)widths are then given as \\({|\\lambda| \\sqrt{1 + f^\\prime(x_o)^2}}\\). This expression describes the quantity that we perceive rather than the quantity that we want to display (\\(\\ell/2\\)), which leads us to a general correction factor of $ {/2 (|| )^{-1}} $. Note that this yields in general two solutions: one for positive, one for negative values of \\(\\lambda\\) corresponding to upper and lower (half-)extant width.\nIn order to get actual numeric values for \\(\\lambda\\), we need to find end points of the extant line width as solutions of intersecting the orthogonal line and the graphs of \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_2\\). We find these end points as solutions in \\(x\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) of the system of equations:\n\\[ x - x_o = \\lambda f^\\prime(x_o)  \\tag{3}\\] \\[ f(x) - f(x_o) = -\\lambda \\pm \\ell/2  \\tag{4}\\]\nNote that the above system of equations involves function values \\(f(x)\\), which implies that solving this system requires numerical optimization for any but the most simple functions \\(f\\).\nIn the following two sections we make use of Taylor approximations of first and second order to find approximate solutions to end points as sketched out in Figure 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) General Correction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Linear Approximation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Quadratic Approximation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Methods based on Approximations to f(x). (a) is the general correction approach, and may require numerical optimization to obtain exact solutions for \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\). (b) uses a first-order Taylor series approximation to \\(f(x)\\) and (c) uses a second-order Taylor series approximation to \\(f(x)\\). The intersection of the function \\(f(x) \\pm \\ell/2\\) and the orthogonal line, \\((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)\\) must be obtained to determine the necessary correction factor.\n\n\n\nFor the linear approximation to \\(f(x)\\) we make use of \\(f(x) \\approx f(x_0) + (x - x_0) f^\\prime(x_0)\\), which together with Equation 3 and Equation 4 yields a correction factor in \\(x_0\\) of \\[ \\ell_{\\text{new}}(x_0) = \\ell_{\\text{old}} \\sqrt{1 +  f^\\prime(x_0)^2}.\\]\nNote that the linear method gives the same result as a varying slope extension from a trigonometric approach suggested by Schonlau (2003) (pg. 3) and used in Hofmann and Vendettuoli (2013).\nA second-order Taylor polynomial approximation to \\(f(x)\\) additionally accounts for the asymmetry in the extant widths on either side of the center trend line.\nA quadratic approximation to \\(f(x)\\) is achieved using the approximation \\(f(x) \\approx f(x_0) + f^\\prime(x_0)(x-x_0) + 1/2 f^{\\prime\\prime}(x_0)(x-x_0)^2\\). This simplifies the system of Equation 3 and Equation 4 to the following quadratic equation in \\(\\lambda\\): \\[\nf^{\\prime\\prime}(x_0)  f^\\prime(x_0)^2 \\lambda^2  + 2(f^\\prime(x_0)^2 + 1) \\lambda  \\pm \\ell = 0,\n\\] which leads us to corrections for the half lengths as (see \\[\n\\ell_{\\text{new}_1}(x_0) = 1 /2 \\cdot  \\left(v + \\sqrt{ v^2 +  f^{\\prime\\prime}(x_0) f^\\prime(x_0)^2\\cdot  \\ell_{\\text{old}}}\\right) \\cdot v^{-1/2}\n\\tag{5}\\]\n\\[\n\\ell_{\\text{new}_2}(x_0) = 1 /2 \\cdot  \\left(v + \\sqrt{ v^2 -  f^{\\prime\\prime}(x_0) f^\\prime(x_0)^2\\cdot  \\ell_{\\text{old}}}\\right) \\cdot v^{-1/2}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nwhere \\(v = 1 + f^\\prime(x_0)^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Uncorrected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Linear correction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Quadratic correction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Quadratic Approximation. In the quadratic approximation top and bottom segments of the vertical lines are adjusted separately.\n\n\n\nAdjusting the top and bottom segments of the vertical lines separately so that the extant width is constant breaks the illusion, but slightly distorts the sinusoidal shape of the peaks.\nFigure 8 shows the correction factor based on a quadratic approximation compared to the untransformed data. Unlike the linear solution, the half-segments here are not necessarily of the same length, and thus there are separate correction factors for each half-segment.\nThe quadratic correction breaks whenever the expression in the square root of Equation 5 and Equation 6 becomes negative, i.e.~whenever \\(v^2 \\pm \\ell\\cdot f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)\\cdot f^\\prime(x)^2 &lt; 0\\). This happens for combinations of large values of \\(\\ell\\), which signify a large vertical extent, or large conditional variability \\(E[Y|X]\\), and simultaneous large changes in the slope of the main trend, i.e.~large values of the curvature \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)\\). In the linear approximation of \\(f\\) the same situation leads to a massive overcorrection of the vertical lines, changing the shape of the ‘corrected’ function beyond recognition.\nSimilar to the correction of the \\(x\\)-axis, we can use a weighted approach to find a balance between counteracting the illusion and representing the original data:\n\\[\n\\ell_{new_w}(x) = (1-w) \\cdot \\ell_{old} + w \\cdot \\ell_{new}(x).\n\\tag{7}\\]"

    "text": "3.1 Study Design\nThe study aims to determine the range of “optimal” transformation weights for each transformation type. Psychophysics methodology typically approaches threshold estimation by using the method of adjustment (Goldstein 2010), where stimuli are provided showing states both above and below the hypothesized optimal value and participants adjust the stimuli until the stated goal is met (in this case, until the lines appear to have equal length). It is expected that there will be a difference in user-reported values from below and from above, and these values are typically averaged to produce a single threshold value (the results from this model are provided in Section 10.2). Instead of averaging these values, we use a mixed model to compare user responses for different starting points to be able to estimate the range of transformation weights.\nThe study is set up as a fractional factorial design of correction type (\\(x\\) or \\(y\\)) and starting weight \\(w_0\\). Each participant is asked to evaluate a total of twelve situations, six of each correction type. Starting weights were chosen as follows: each user was given a trial of each type starting at 0 and 1. The remaining four trials of each type had starting weights chosen with equal probability from \\(0.25\\) to \\(0.75\\) (see Figure 9).\nWe decided to have a higher coverage density for starting weights around 0.6 after a pilot study indicated a preference for that value. Using a distribution with a wide coverage allows us to more fully explore the space of plausible weights \\(w\\) while focusing on the \\((0,1)\\) interval and enabling precise estimation of the optimal weight in the region indicated by the pilot study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Overview of possible starting weights. Weight values are discrete, but staggered so as to provide fine-grained adjustments around 0.6 and more coarse discriminatory information toward the outside.\n\n\n\nA trial begins with the presentation of a graph at the chosen starting weight \\(w_0\\). Participants are asked to adjust the graph using increment and decrement buttons. A trial ends with the participant clicking the ‘submit’ button, at which point the weight for the final adjustment is recorded. This provides a clear starting value and ending value, allowing us to assess the range of optimal values for each participant. In addition to starting weight, correction type, and anonymized user-specific data (partial IP address, hashed IP address, and hashed browser characteristics), each incremental weight is recorded with a corresponding time stamp. Specifications of a user’s browser turned out to be sufficient as an anonymous, yet individual ‘fingerprint’."

    "text": "3.2 Results\nParticipants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk and the reddit community. As this study was conducted outside a laboratory setting, we can not gauge a participant’s willingness to follow the guidelines and put in their best effort. This, besides potential technical issues (server outage, speed of response) make a careful selection of data going into the analysis necessary. The specific data exclusion criteria are provided in Section 10.1.\nThe following analysis is based on the cleaned data, consisting of 125 participants with 1210 valid trial results. The results from the standard psychophysics model (provided in Section 10.2) suggest that some transformation is necessary to break the illusion, yet a complete transformation is not needed. For an estimate of the range of acceptable transformation weights we use a linear model that incorporates starting points other than 0 and 1, and allows for user-specific variability.\nIn order to account for user-level variability, we fit a random effects model for the adjusted weight value as a function of starting weight and trial type, with a random intercept for each participant. The exact model specification and parameter estimates can be found in Section 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Simulation results from the fitted model, facetted by correction type. Fixed effects results are shown as histograms; the red values display the results when starting from an uncorrected plot and are concentrated around \\(w=0.1\\) for \\(X\\) and \\(w=0.14\\) for \\(Y\\); the blue values represent user-chosen weights when starting from a fully corrected plot and are concentrated around \\(w=0.62\\) for \\(X\\) and \\(w=0.67\\) for \\(Y\\). Additionally, 95% bootstrap intervals are shown as horizontal line segments above the histograms; these intervals are for the lower and upper bounds of the “preferred weight interval” tested in the experiment. User-level density curves show the individual variability around fixed effects \\(\\alpha_*\\) and \\(\\alpha_*+\\beta\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 10 gives an overview of the relationship between starting weights and user-preferred weight values. Higher starting weights are associated with higher user-submitted values, while lower starting weights result in lower user-submitted values. The ranges of optimal weights are similar under both transformations. Boundaries for the \\(X\\) transformation are slightly lower than boundaries for \\(Y\\).\nBootstrap simulations for each of the coefficients suggest that the range of acceptable shrinkage values \\(w\\) is between 0.098 and 0.625 for \\(x\\) and 0.144 and 0.671 for \\(y\\), where the lower value is the estimate starting at \\(w=0\\) and moving up, and the upper value is the estimate starting at \\(w=1\\) and moving down. This suggests that either correction is preferable to an uncorrected graph, and that a weighted correction is preferable to the fully corrected graph, as neither 0 nor 1 is contained in any overall interval. In addition to showing the strength of the correction, this experiment also demonstrates the strength of the illusion itself: corrected line lengths appear more uniform than uncorrected ones, even though the corrected lengths are not uniform while the uncorrected lengths are completely uniform."

    "text": "Annotation Key\n\nStudy design and data collection\nSetting - location, timeframe, recruitment/inclusion criteria\nSampling method\nVariables collected (and any derived variables)\nStatistical analysis methods\nThe purpose of the poliomyelitis vaccine evaluation program in the field trial of 1954 was to seek a measure of the prophylactic effect of the preparations of vaccine to be used, the only assumptions ’being that the experimental background was sound and that the vaccine was to be antigenic and noninfectious. The undertaking meant the acceptance of a public and scientific trust to provide, so far as possible, an objective analysis and unprejudiced appraisal of data obtained from numerous study areas. It must be fully realized that the evaluation program was not a tightly knit operation carried on by a single group of investigators. Rather, it was a wide-spread series of investigations that the vaccine evaluation center at the University of Michigan sought to integrate by obtaining uniform acceptance of instructions and procedures and, thus, to maintain uniformity of understanding and performance and completeness and ac- curacy of investigation and report. In effect, then, the center served as the executive agency for a study dependent upon the willingness, interest, and cooperation of the local medical profession, both administrative and practicing, and of their affiliated personnel. But, in addition, there was the extended network of virus laboratories, geographically distributed, to aid in the specific diagnosis of reported cases; a large number of specially oriented physical therapists who would make detailed examinations of the muscular status of each patient in assigned study areas. Beyond this was the great background of public interest leading to their voluntary participation in an investigation that was, in the end, completely dependent upon their support1.\nAll data from all areas were transmitted to the center on forms devised for the specific step. Throughout the study period the major effort of the staff of the center was concentrated on getting the necessary information from the different agencies responsible for the actual work at the local level. All possible means were used to eliminate delays, inaccuracies, or omissions in the requisite reports, with the result that a high degree of completeness was finally attained."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Steps\n\nCreate a github repository that is named “portfolio” and located at https://github.com/username/portfolio (where username is your github username).\nCreate a quarto website (I recommend a blog – it will make it easier to keep track of when things are updated) by following these directions.\n\nChange the build directory in _quarto.yml to docs\n\nBuild the default site (customize it later) with Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + B.\nAdd the files to git, including the /docs folder. Push your site (along with the /docs folder containing the rendered site) to GitHub. You can customize it later.\n\nOn GitHub, set your site to render to the docs directory (detailed instructions).\n\nCreate an empty .nojekyll file in the main directory of your project repository\nConfigure your GitHub repository (Settings -&gt; Pages -&gt; Build and Deployment) to publish the /docs directory of the main branch of your repository.\n\nCheck the rendered site (it should have an address of https://.github.io/portfolio) – it may take ~5 minutes to appear after you’ve completed step 4.\nMake any tweaks to your site that you’d like to make – add pictures, a biography, posts about your interests, etc.\n\nThe goal of this is to have a place where you can showcase your coursework for future employers. Keep it professional (but it’s ok to have some information about your hobbies, if you want to show that dimension of yourself).\nThe department may eventually want to showcase some of these sites so that incoming students can see what current students accomplish as part of our courses. We will ask permission first!\n\n\n\n\nUpdating your site\nRendering your site will be done manually – thus, each time you want to update the actual site, you’ll have to run the following commands in the terminal (not the R console):\nquarto render # Can also be accomplished by Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + B\ngit add docs\ngit commit -m \"Publish site to docs/\"\ngit push\n(You can also accomplish this by hitting the Render button in RStudio and then adding and committing the docs folder in the git pane in RStudio.)\nIf you’re feeling fancy, you can automate this process using a GitHub action, but this is fiddly and probably not worth it unless you’re actually planning to use this as a blog and update it frequently. If you decide to set everything up with Github Actions, I can offer a minimal amount of help with debugging, but even I find them confusing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionRendering your site\n\n\n\nUpdating the markdown files is not enough – you have to render (in e.g. RStudio) and push the docs folder for changes to show up on Github pages.\nIf things aren’t working,\n\nRun render via RStudio or by using quarto render . on the command line (in the project folder).\nLook for any un-pushed changes, either in the Git pane of RStudio (hit refresh) or by running git status on the command line.\nCheck that the docs/ folder has been committed AND pushed to GitHub.\nAsk for help, either in class during some downtime, or by making an office hours appointment."

When the water temperature is above this point, the plant must operate at reduced capacity, as it cannot transfer additional thermal energy into the water.\nAssemble data from one or more reputable sources (USGS, NOAA, US Energy Information Administration). Make an operational assessment of the risk that the plant will have to operate at reduced capacity during the next 5 years. Consider both the probability of reduced operating capacity as well as the timing of that capacity (e.g. you should also look at electrical usage during those periods)."

Your colleagues will also be evaluating the same scenario, and your reports will be used in aggregate to determine a consensus (or lack thereof) on the company’s action. The reports will also be used to inform downsizing that is rumored to be coming - you want to ensure your report is better than your peers so that you aren’t as easy to cut.\nYou may talk to your peers who are assigned the same scenario, but you do not want to collaborate too closely, lest you both become targets of the rumored layoffs.\n\nI’ve scaffolded this report for you to make this process easier - as we talk about different sections of a report in class and read about how to create similar sections, you will practice by writing the equivalent section of your report.\nThe basic steps for this task are as follows:\n\nIdentify the research question from the business question\nIdentify data set(s) which are (1) publicly available (you don’t have a budget to pay for private data) and (2) relevant to your task\n\n(HW Week 6) Document your data sets in draft-data-doc.qmd\n\nConduct a statistical analysis to support your answer to your research and business questions\n\nWrite a methods section for your business report corresponding to your statistical analysis\n(HW Week 9) Draft of results section of business report with relevant graphics/visual aids in draft-results.qmd\n\nWrite your report\n\n(HW Week 10) Draft of Intro/Conclusion sections in draft-intro-conclusions.qmd\n(HW Week 11) Draft of Executive summary section in draft-exec-summary.qmd\n\nRevise your report\n\n(HW Week 12 – not turned in) Revise your report\n(HW Week 13) - Rough draft of report due. Create one or more qmd files for your report (you can overwrite or delete intro.qmd and summary.qmd), include the names of each file (in order) in _quarto.yml. You should use references (edit references.bib and use pandoc citations). Make sure your report compiles and looks reasonable in both html and pdf.\nDevelop a presentation to go along with your report (Week 13). Create slides for your report using quarto.\n\nPeer revise reports\n\nPeer revise reports\n(HW Week 14) - Make edits to your report from comments received from peer review\n\nFinal report & presentation due"

    "text": "4.3 Attendance & Participation\nAll students are expected to attend and fully participate in class. Participation grades will be determined based on a combination of attendance checks and participation, including professionalism and engagement. Consistent, repeated failure to attend class or actively participate in the course will affect the participation portion of your grade.\nOne absence is allowed without any reduction in participation score - no excuse is necessary! Please do not email me when you use your one excuse-free absence.\nThe university requires me to hold class through the entire semester, which means that you are required to participate in class for the entire semester. Any non-university-excused travel you choose to do that results in missing class can, and probably will, affect your grade. This includes the final exam period - travel is not an excuse for failure to attend the final exam, if activities are planned for that period.\n\n4.3.1 Illness\nIf you are feeling ill, please do not come to class. Instead, review the material and work on the homework assignment, and then schedule an appointment with me to meet virtually. In the appointment reason field on Calendly, indicate that this appointment is to substitute for your in-class participation on the date you missed.\nIf you need to miss more than 1-2 classes for illness, I reserve the right to require documentation from Disability Services or a medical provider in order to continue using this substitute for attendance grades.\n\n\n4.3.2 Inclement Weather\nIf in-person classes are canceled, you will be notified of the instructional continuity plan for this class by Canvas Announcement. In most circumstances where there is power in the Lincoln area, we will hold class via Zoom if the university cancels class. You will be held to the same participation standards on Zoom as you are in person, and participation and attendance will be graded accordingly, with some allowance for disruption at the individual level where circumstances warrant.",

    "text": "4.5 Homework\nWeekly formative assignments (assignments meant to help you practice skills) will be given throughout the semester. The only way to learn the skills taught in this course is to practice - writing, citing, doing research, summarizing, and so on.\n\nYou will typically have one week to work on each of the assignments.\nAssignments must be submitted in the file format specified, and should run or compile as submitted for credit to be given.\nI will attempt to grade formative assignments within a week of the specified due date.\nFormative assessments may be resubmitted for partial credit subject to the terms of the resubmission policy below.\n\nIt is critical to keep up with the work as assigned in this course. While it is possible to churn out a term paper in 4 hours of madness, the writing quality of said term paper will be sub-optimal at best. This course is designed to help you learn how to write and communicate effectively, which requires planning, thought, and revision. These steps are not compatible with last-minute fever-dream writing.\n\n4.5.1 Late Work Policy\nLate assignments will be accepted only under extenuating circumstances, and only if you have contacted me prior to the assignment due date and received permission to hand the assignment in late. I reserve the right not to grade (or to assign a 0 to) any assignments received after the assignment due date.\nLogistics: Assignments are due at 6 pm on Fridays. There is a grace period of uncertain length between the assignment submission deadline and when I start grading the assignment - if it is submitted by the time I start grading, I don’t need to know it was late.\n\nTurned in at 6:05 pm on Friday, I start grading at 2 pm on Sunday \\(\\rightarrow\\) fine. If you email me and alert me that your assignment was late by 5 minutes (or 12 hours), I may fill the 0 in for efficiency’s sake.\nTurned in at 9:30 am on Sunday, I graded everything Saturday afternoon \\(\\rightarrow\\) 0 for the assignment (unless you have permission, etc.). Use the comment box on the Canvas assignment to request a “resubmission” to trigger the resubmission policy.\n\nYou may submit a homework assignment that was not submitted on time as a resubmission, if you submit it within one week of the assignment due date, assuming it meets the conditions below.\n\n\n4.5.2 Resubmission Policy\nLearning how to write is a process that requires an attempt and then subsequent improvement. Do not be afraid to make mistakes! I will allow you to re-submit two formative/homework assignments (one time each). You have a week from the time the assignment is returned to you to resubmit it for a regrade.\nI am happy to provide feedback on revisions (after submission) without a grade update, subject to other constraints on my time.\nNote: The resubmission policy does NOT apply to quizzes, projects, or exams.\nThis policy is subject to the following constraints:\n\nYou should resubmit assignments as soon as possible.\nYou may not resubmit an assignment for which solutions have been posted.\nEach assignment should be resubmitted only once.\nResubmissions are due no later than 1 week after the assignment has been returned with comments. In addition,\n\nResubmissions of assignments due before Spring Break are due at 6 pm the Friday before Spring Break (March 13, 2026)\nResubmissions of assignments due after Spring Break must be submitted by Monday at 6 pm of week 15 of classes (April 27, 2026)\n\nResubmitted assignments will be graded at my convenience.\n\n\n\nI spend the extra time grading resubmissions because it reinforces your learning; this policy is not designed to improve your grade in this class.\nI reserve the right to adjust the resubmission policy over the course of the semester to ensure that it is meeting the objective of reinforcing your learning.\nI reserve the right to limit or penalize resubmissions if it becomes clear that the current policy does not promote learning of the material and/or support the course objectives.",

    "text": "4.6 Projects\nYou will complete two major projects in this course: a business-style report and presentation, and a user guide for a software package or implementation decision relating to a specific topic. The business report will include a presentation and will be compiled over the second half of the semester. The user guide is due a week before Spring Break.\n\n4.6.1 Late Projects\nWriting is an iterative process that requires time - it’s good to write a draft and step away for a day before you revise it. As a result, projects in this course have been designed to encourage this iteration. You have at least 3 weeks to work on both projects outside of class.\nWith this in mind, late projects will not be accepted without evidence of severe, ongoing (&gt;1 week) extenuating circumstances of a severity that must be documented with your adviser and student services. In addition, to access an accommodation for late project work, you must provide a GitHub commit history that shows ongoing engagement with the project before the circumstance occurred. This policy is intended to discourage you from waiting until the last minute to complete your projects, as this does not allow you the time to practice iterative writing and revisions and builds bad writing habits.\n\n\n4.6.2 Project Presentation Attendance\nDO NOT make travel plans that assume you will not have to attend the final exam period.\nIf there are too many projects to present during Week 15 of the course, we will continue with project presentations during the final exam period. All students must be present for project presentations, and failure to attend your peers’ presentations will result in a reduction of your project score and your participation score for the course.",

    "section": "4.7 Evaluation and Academic Integrity",
    "text": "4.7 Evaluation and Academic Integrity\nStudents are expected to adhere to guidelines concerning academic dishonesty outlined in Article III B.1 of the University’s Student Code of Conduct. The Statistics Department academic integrity and grade appeal policy is available here.\nThe policies detailed below are policies I have defined in addition to the university and departmental policies.\nSummary: I can, at my discretion, give students an oral exam on their submitted assignment that can replace the graded assignment itself. That is, if you submitted it, you should be able to defend, discuss, and justify your work.\n\n4.7.1 Evaluation Criteria\nIn every assignment, discussion, and written component of this class, you are expected to demonstrate that you are intellectually engaging with the material. I will evaluate you based on this engagement, which means that technically correct but low effort answers which do not demonstrate engagement or understanding will receive no credit.\nWhen you answer questions in this class, your goal is to show that you either understand the material or are actively engaging with it. If you did not achieve this goal, then your answer is incomplete, regardless of whether or not it is technically correct. This is not to encourage you to add unnecessary complexity to your answer - simple, elegant solutions are always preferable to unwieldy, complex solutions that accomplish the same task.\nGrammar and spelling are important, as is your ability to communicate technical information clearly in a written format; both of these criteria will be used in addition to assignment-specific rubrics to evaluate your work.\n\n\n4.7.2 Code\nYou must be able to explain how the logic works for any code you turn in. This means that code you obtained from e.g. StackOverflow is fine to use if you can explain it and modify it for the purposes of this class, but if you cannot explain your code you will not get credit for the assignment. This is in line with what is generally considered acceptable behavior in programming - reuse is fine (subject to the code’s license) but you must be able to fully explain and modify any code you did not write yourself. You should also provide a link to the source of your code (or even the logic behind your code) - this is useful both for my information and for future you, in addition to being a good way to give attribution to the original author.\n\n\n4.7.3 Writing\nWith the proliferation of AI large language models, I reserve the right to replace project and homework grades with grades based on an oral discussion of your submissions. If you cannot explain the logic behind your submission, how you came to the approach you used, and identify the tradeoffs behind decisions you made, then you will not receive credit. LLMs can be a useful tool, but this course’s objectives are meant to assess your ability to communicate statistical information to a target audience effectively, not your ability to use LLMs. Fundamentally, you need to understand concepts and develop written fluency in technical language and statistical concepts to communicate effectively; generative AI solutions may hamper both of these goals if you rely on them too much.\n\n\n4.7.4 Generative AI\nTechnical writing is more clear and concise than other types of writing, and nuances are extremely important. To date, generative AI is not particularly good at these goals - it is wordy, sometimes uses odd phrasing, and (most importantly), as a predictive model, it cannot structure its output for human understanding. It may be useful to leverage AI tools to ensure that your work conforms to grammar and style guidelines, but I very highly discourage the use of generative AI to actually write content. I highly prefer your writing, even with some mistakes, to the bland content generated by most LLMs.\nAny use of generative AI must be disclosed in an appendix to your submission - this includes brainstorming, editing, using AI as spell-check/grammar-check, and so on. You must document the following:\n\nthe version of the generative AI used (e.g. Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT 5.2, Copilot GPT-5 chat)\nthe full sequence of prompts and responses\nany additional inputs you provided to the AI system (documents, images, etc.)\na “diff” between the AI responses and your submission, showing exactly what was generated by the AI system and what you changed. If you are using quarto, you can use the diff command line tool to get this (you may have to fix headers) after you’ve pasted the AI text into its own document.",

I don’t expect you to read the whole report in less than an hour (or ever) - just skim through the report to get a sense of its structure and design, and read a few bits here and there to determine their relevance.\nThen, evaluate your report using the following questions:\nWhat is the basic argument that the report is making?\nWhat rhetorical choices did the author(s) make when supporting their argument?\nIs the argument convincing?\nDiscuss your answers in your group and be prepared to share with the rest of the class in the last 15 minutes of class.\nA guided version of this activity is provided for Week 5’s 2nd lecture."

Nuance, in Healy’s argument, is the tendency to make theories more complicated by adding unnecessary complexity, rather than reducing complexity and making strong statements. Healy presents three ‘nuance traps’ which plague sociology and argues against it from multiple different perspectives.\nReliability assessment: The author is a professor of sociology at Duke University and has many different publications in the field. As a result, he is likely qualified to critique the field from an insider’s perspective. As this is just a template of an annotated bibliography and this article is unrelated to a review article, I cannot easily assess how this article relates to the review article or overall topic (but you should).\nMissing information:\n\nI do not understand sociology enough to have seen this tendency in the field (but it seems to apply well enough to statistics)\nThe aesthetic argument against nuance is a bit tricky to understand and may require reading up on Davis (1971) - what makes theory interesting. Healy argues that interesting is more important than truth (based on Davis) and that nuance can thus occasionally be interesting but is perhaps more often dull. Without being familiar with Davis, it is hard to know if I’m understanding this component of the argument."

Please leave the topic.qmd file as an appendix, to document the different stages of this project.\nOnce we’ve agreed on a topic for your user guide, you will proceed to needs.qmd and task-analysis.qmd. Both will be submitted at the same check-in, and both will be included in your final report as appendices. You should be able to re-purpose most of the information in task-analysis.qmd to orient the user to different components of the task you’ve chosen.\nYour next step is to actually write the content that satisfies the work you outlined in task-analysis.qmd.\nOnce you’re finished with that, ideally, you’ll have plenty of time to edit and streamline your report. Feel free to trade reports with a friend and try to complete your friend’s task - this will help you both identify areas where the guide isn’t as clear. Try to complete the task with a different data set - that often helps find trouble spots.\nWhen you submit your final report, you may remove index.qmd from the _quarto.yml file, which will remove this chapter (which is quite unnecessary for your user) from the report. You should also take the time to make sure your name is listed as both author and copyright holder in the _quarto.yml file. Feel free to make a custom cover for your manual if you would like to do so. You can also tweak the CSS/theme for the book, so long as you’re conscious of accessibility concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionBuilding the report\n\n\n\nIf you are using RStudio to complete this report, you can hit (Ctrl/Cmd)-Shift-B to build the whole report. You can also type quarto render . on the command line in the project folder to accomplish the same thing.\nIf you have questions about how to customize or debug your book, it may be helpful to start at the quarto book documentation [@positpbcCreatingBook2024]."

You should consider both the probability of a coastal -&gt; inland tornadic event and the consequences – a F0 tornado is unlikely to have the power to lift sharks from the water, while an F5 tornado might have the ability to transport many sharks inland.

You can read a bit about BibLaTeX here – in particular for this class, the section on “The bibliography file” is useful and will show you what a bib file looks like.\nBib files are perhaps even more painful to maintain by hand than an actual MLA/APA style bibliography. Luckily, Zotero handles that for us too.\n\nThis section relies heavily on having Quick Copy in Zotero (Settings -&gt; Export -&gt; Quick Copy, Item Format set to BibLaTeX) set to BibLaTeX. If you haven’t set that, please do so now.\n\n\nFor each project and some regular assignments in this class, we’re going to have a .bib file with all of the references you collect."

This isn’t fully manual – we don’t have to write the bib entries ourselves (like I did in graduate school). Let’s try that first before I show you other ways to connect RStudio to Zotero.\n\nCreate a text file called references.bib (make sure it has the extension .bib and not .bib.txt, particularly if your operating system hides file extensions from you).\nIn a browser, navigate to “Cows painted with zebra-like striping can avoid biting fly attack”, another 2025 IgNobel award winning paper. Use Zotero connector to add the paper to Zotero, and make sure that all of the necessary fields1 are filled in correctly.\n\n\n\n\nHighlighted fields are essential – title, authors, publication (with vol/issue/pages if available), date, and either DOI or URL.\n\n\n\nSelect both IgNobel papers in Zotero and use Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+C (Quick copy) to get the BibLaTeX entries. Paste them into your references.bib file. Your file should look something like the lines below. I have removed the abstracts and file locations from my file for brevity’s sake.\n\n#| echo: false\n\ncat references.bib\n\nCreate a quarto file in RStudio or your IDE of choice. In the YAML metadata at the top, add bibliography: references.bib as an option. A minimal file with a title would look like this.\n\n---\ntitle: \"Testing References\"\nbibliography: references.bib\n---\n\nAdd a sentence summarizing each of the two IgNobel papers. For the Cow stripe paper, use an inline reference – \\@citation-key, and for the Ethanol paper, use a parenthetical reference – (\\@citation-key), where in both cases, citation-key is the first piece of the bib entry after \\@article{. When you’ve finished, take a peek at mine to see if your citation style is similar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSample quarto file text\n\n\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Testing References\"\nbibliography: references.bib\n---\n\nTo test whether zebra stripes prevent biting fly attacks,\n@kojimaCowsPaintedZebralike2019 painted cows with black-and-white,\nblack-only, and no stripes and recorded the number of fly repelling behaviors\nand flies on the body and legs.\n\nTo test how Egyptian fruit bats are affected by ethanol (which occurs\nnaturally in fruit), researchers gave Egyptian fruit bats ethanol-rich and\nethanol-free food, finding that flight speed, echolocation calls, and\nbehavior were negatively impacted by the presence of ethanol\n(@sanchezEthanolIngestionAffects2010).\n\n\n\n\nYou can see the rendered file here – notice that the in-line citations are automatically included along with a references section at the end of the file.\n\nWhat if we want to change the citation format?

    "text": "We all use statistical graphics, but how do we know that the graphics we use are communicating properly? When creating a graphic, we must consider the design choices most effective for conveying the intended result. For instance, we may decide to highlight the relationship between two variables in a scatterplot by including a trend line, or adding color to highlight clustering (VanderPlas and Hofmann 2017). These design choices require that we understand the perceptual and visual biases that come into play when creating graphics, and as graphics are evaluated visually, we must use human testing to ground our understanding in empiricism.\nMuch of the research on the perception of visual features in charts has been conducted in psychophysics and tests for accuracy and quantitative comparisons when understanding a plot. Cleveland and McGill (1984) conducted a series of cognitive tasks designed to establish a hierarchy of visual components for making comparisons. For example, it is more effective to display information on an \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) axis rather than using color in order to reduce the visual effort necessary to make numerical comparisons. Cleveland and McGill (1985) found that assessing the position of points along an axis is easier than determining the slope of a line. Other studies focused on the viewers’ ability to perceive the strength of the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates in a scatterplot. For instance, when the data appear dense, viewers tend to overestimate the magnitude of the correlation coefficient (Cleveland, Diaconis, and McGill 1982; Lauer and Post 1989). Cleveland (1993) provided an argument for displaying cyclical patterns with an aspect ratio which sets the curve close to 45\\(^{\\circ}\\). Kosslyn and Kosslyn (2006) examined how Gestalt principles of perceptual organization are instrumental in extracting data from a chart. For example, Ciccione and Dehaene (2020) conducted a study to support data points located closer together are more likely to be perceived as the same group and Appelle (1972) found that it is easier to discriminate vertical and horizontal lines than oblique lines. The results of these cognitive tasks provided some consistent guidance for chart design; however, other methods of visual testing can further evaluate design choices and help us understand cognitive biases related to the evaluation of statistical charts.\n\n\nWe need human testing of graphics in order to draw broad conclusions, develop guidelines for graphical design, and improve graphical communication. Studies might ask participants to identify differences in graphs, read information off of a chart accurately, use data to make correct real-world decisions, or predict the next few observations. All of these types of tests require different levels of use and manipulation of the information being presented in the chart. Early research studies considered graphs from a psychological perspective (Spence 1990; Lewandowsky and Spence 1989), testing participants’ abilities to detect a stimulus or a difference between two stimuli. Psychophysical methods have been used to test graphical perception, as in VanderPlas and Hofmann (2015a), which used the method of adjustment - a technique which requires participants to alter a changing stimulus to match a given constant stimuli (Gescheider 1997)- to estimate the magnitude of the impact of the sine illusion. However, there are more modern testing methods that have been developed since the heyday of psychophysics.\nOne major development in statistical graphics which led to more advanced testing methods is Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson 2013). The Grammar of Graphics serves as the fundamental framework for data visualization with the notion that graphics are built from the ground up by specifying exactly how to create a particular graph from a given data set. Visual representations are constructed through the use of “tidy data” which is characterized as a data set in which each variable is in its own column, each observation is in its own row, and each value is in its own cell (Wickham and Grolemund 2016). Graphics are viewed as a mapping from variables in a data set (or statistics computed from the data) to visual attributes such as the axes, colors, shapes, or facets on the canvas in which the chart is displayed. Software, such as Hadley Wickham’s ggplot2 (Wickham 2011), aims to implement the framework of creating charts and graphics as the Grammar of Graphics recommends.\nCombining the Grammar of Graphics with another tool for statistical graphics testing, the statistical lineup, yields a method for evaluating graphical design choices. Buja et al. (2009) introduced the lineup protocol to provide a framework for inferential testing. A statistical lineup is a plot consisting of smaller panels where the viewer is asked to identify the target panel containing the real data from among a set of decoy null plots which display data under the assumption there is no relationship. If the viewer can identify the target panel randomly embedded within the set of null panels, this suggests that the real data is visually distinct from data generated under the null model. Through experimentation, methods such as the lineup protocol allow researchers to conduct studies geared at understanding human ability to conduct tasks related to the perception of statistical charts such as differentiation, prediction, estimation, and extrapolation (VanderPlas and Hofmann 2017, 2015b; Hofmann et al. 2012). The advancement of graphing software provides the tools necessary to develop new methods of testing statistical graphics. While these testing methods are excellent, there is one particular subset of statistical graphics testing methods which we intend to develop further in this paper: assessing graphics by fitting statistical models “by eye”.\n\n\n\nInitial studies in the 20th century explored the use of fitting lines by eye through a set of points (Unwin and Wills 1988; Finney 1951; Mosteller et al. 1981). Common methods of fitting trends by eye involved maneuvering a string, black thread, or ruler until the fit is suitable, then drawing the line through the set of points. Recently, Ciccione and Dehaene (2021) conducted a comprehensive set of studies investigating human ability to detect trends in graphical representations using physical adjustment and manipulation methods.\nFinney (1951) used graphical testing for computational purposes: to determine the effect of stopping iterative maximum likelihood calculations after one iteration. Many techniques in statistical analysis are performed with the aid of iterative calculations such as Newton’s method or Fisher’s scoring. The author was interested in whether one iteration of calculations was sufficient in the estimation of parameters connected with pharmaceutical dose-response relationships. In pharmaceuticals, one measure of interest is the relative potency between a test preparation of doses and standard preparation of does; relative potency is calculated as the ratio of two equally effective doses between the two preparation methods. In this study, twenty-one scientists were recruited via postal mail and asked to “rule two lines” in order to judge by eye the positions for a pair of parallel probit regression lines in a biological assay. The author then computed one iterative calculation of the relative potency based on starting values as determined by the pair of lines drawn by each participant. The author then compared these relative potency estimates to that which was estimated by the full probit technique (reaching convergence through multiple iterations). Results of the study indicated that one cycle of iterations for calculating the relative potency was sufficient based on the starting values provided by eye from the participants.\nMosteller et al. (1981) sought to understand the properties of least squares and other computed lines by establishing one systematic method of fitting lines by eye. Participants were asked to fit lines by eye to four scatterplots using an 8.5 x 11 inch transparency with a straight line etched completely across the middle. A latin square design with packets of the set of points stapled together in four different sequences was used to determine if there is an effect of order of presentation. It was found that order of presentation had no effect and that participants tended to fit the slope of the principal axis (PA) (error minimized orthogonally, both horizontal and vertical, to the regression line) over the slope of the least squares regression line (error minimized vertically to the regression line). \nIn Ciccione and Dehaene (2021), participants were asked to judge trends, estimate slopes, and conduct extrapolation. To estimate slopes, participants were asked to report the slope of the best-fitting regression line using a track-pad to adjust the tilt of a line on the screen. Results indicated the slopes participants reported were always in excess of the ideal slopes, both in the positive and in the negative direction, and those biases increase with noise and with number of points. This supports the results found in Mosteller et al. (1981) and suggest that participants might use Deming regression (Deming 1943; Linnet 1998; Martin 2000), which minimizes the Euclidean distance of points from the line, when fitting a line to a noisy scatterplot.\nWhile not explicitly intended for perceptual testing, in 2015, the New York Times introduced an interactive feature, called ‘You Draw It’ (Aisch, Cox, and Quealy 2015; Buchanan, Park, and Pearce 2017; Katz 2017). Readers were asked to input their own assumptions about various metrics and compare how these assumptions relate to reality. The New York Times team utilizes Data Driven Documents (D3) (Bostock, Ogievetsky, and Heer 2011) that allows readers to predict these metrics through the use of drawing a line on their computer screen with their computer mouse. After the reader has completed drawing the line, the actual observed values are revealed and the reader may check their estimated knowledge against the actual reported data. While this interactive feature is designed to get readers to confront their own intuitions about data in the news, we feel that the interactivity of this method may be useful for the purpose of graphical testing and measuring the patterns humans see in data.\nIn this paper, we establish ‘You Draw It’, adapted from the New York Times feature, as a new tool for graphical testing. Our visual system is naturally built to look for structure and identify patterns. For instance, points going down from left to right indicates a negative correlation between the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) variables. Our research is intended to implement the ‘You Draw It’ feature as a way to measure the patterns we see in data. The graphical testing method used in this study differs from prior methods found in Mosteller et al. (1981) and Ciccione and Dehaene (2021) by allowing participants to freely draw estimated trend lines - a method which extends nicely to a nonlinear setting. We validate the ‘You Draw It’ method by replicating the less technological study conducted by Mosteller et al. (1981). In Section 2 we describe our participant sample, the graphical task to be completed, and the data generation process and study design. Section 3 describes the participant data collected and shares results from the analyses of the data using mixed models. Overall conclusions and discussion of results are presented in Section 4 with extensions to the current work suggested in Section 5. The RShiny applet to complete the study, participant data used for analysis, and code to replicate the analysis can be found in the Section 6. Based on previous research, we hypothesize that visual regression tends to mimic regression based on the principal axis rather than an ordinary least squares regression. In order to assess this hypothesis, we introduce a method for statistically modeling the participant drawn lines using generalized additive mixed models (GAMM). While the focus of this paper is to share the results from the validation study which uses the new ‘You Draw It’ method to evaluate visually fitted linear trends to statistical regression results, the intent of this work is to set the foundation and demonstrate the strength of the combination of the ‘You Draw It’ method and GAMM analyses for testing statistical graphics and to extend the use of the method beyond the linear setting."

Data were collected as a part of a pilot study meant to test the applet; therefore, either voluntary participant dropout or disconnection from a server not designed to accommodate large magnitudes of participants resulted in missing plots in our data set for analysis. All participants had normal or corrected to normal vision and signed an informed consent form. The experimental tasks took approximately 15 minutes to complete. As this is a pilot study, participants from Twitter and Reddit pages related to data visualization voluntarily completed the study and likely have an interest in fields related to statistics and want to help advance research in graphics. While this study does utilize a convenience sample, as this is primarily a perceptual task, previous results have found few differences between expert and non-expert participants in this context (VanderPlas and Hofmann 2015b). These data were collected to validate this method of graphical testing, with the hopes of providing a new tool to assess graphical perception interactively. Participants completed the experiment on their own computers in an environment of their choosing.

Parameter choices S, F, and N simulated data across a domain of 0 to 20. Parameter choice F produced a trend with a positive slope and a large variance while N had a negative slope and a large variance. In comparison, S showed a trend with a positive slope and a small variance while V yielded a steep positive slope with a small variance over the domain of 4 to 16.

Each data set was generated randomly and independently for each participant at the start of the experiment and mapped to a scatterplot. Participants in the study were shown two ‘You Draw It’ practice plots in order to train participants in the skills associated with executing the task - in particular, the responsiveness of the applet requires that participants draw a line at a certain speed, ensuring that all of the evenly spaced points along the hand-drawn line are filled in. During the practice session, participants were provided with instruction prompts accompanied by a .gif and a practice plot. Instructions guided participants to start at the edge of the yellow box, to make sure the yellow shaded region was moving along with their mouse as they drew, and that they could draw over their already drawn line. Practice plots were then followed by one of each of the four ‘You Draw It’ task plots associated with the current study (S, F, V, and N).

Figure 3 illustrates the difference between an OLS regression line which minimizes the vertical distance of points from the line and a regression line based on the PA which minimizes the Euclidean distance of points (orthogonal) from the line.\nDue to the randomness in the data generation process, the actual slope of the linear regression line fit through the simulated points could differ from the predetermined slope. Therefore, we fit an OLS regression to each scatterplot to obtain estimated parameters \\(\\hat\\beta_{0,OLS}\\) and \\(\\hat\\beta_{1,OLS}\\). Fitted values, \\(\\hat y_{k,OLS}\\), were then obtained every 0.25 increment across the domain from the OLS regression equation, \\(\\hat y_{k,OLS} = \\hat\\beta_{0,OLS} + \\hat\\beta_{1,OLS} x_k\\), for \\(k = 1, ..., 4 x_{max} +1\\). The PA regression slope, \\(\\hat\\beta_{1,PA}\\), and y-intercept, \\(\\hat\\beta_{0,PA}\\), were determined using the mcreg function in the mcr package in R (Manuilova, Schuetzenmeister, and Model 2021) which implements Deming regression (equivalent to a regression based on the slope of the first principal axis). Fitted values, \\(\\hat y_{k,PA}\\) were then obtained every 0.25 increment across the domain from the PA regression equation, \\(\\hat y_{k,PA} = \\hat\\beta_{0,PA} + \\hat\\beta_{1,PA} x_k\\), for \\(k = 1, ..., 4 x_{max} +1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Comparison between an OLS regression line which minimizes the vertical distance of points from the line and a regression line based on the principal axis which minimizes the Euclidean distance of points (orthogonal) from the line."

    "text": "3.2 Residual Trends\nFor each participant, the final data set used for analysis contained \\(x_{ijk}, y_{ijk,drawn}, \\hat y_{ijk,OLS}\\), and \\(\\hat y_{ijk,PA}\\) for parameter choice \\(i = 1,2,3,4\\), j = \\(1,...,N_{participant}\\), and \\(x_{ijk}\\) value for increment \\(k = 1, ...,4 x_{max} + 1\\). Using both a linear mixed model and a generalized additive mixed model, comparisons of vertical residuals in relation to the OLS fitted values (\\(e_{ijk,OLS} = y_{ijk,drawn} - \\hat y_{ijk,OLS}\\)) and PA fitted values (\\(e_{ijk,PA} = y_{ijk,drawn} - \\hat y_{ijk,PA}\\)) were made across the domain. Figure 4 displays an example of all three fitted trend lines for parameter choice F.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Illustrates the data associated with and collected for one `You Draw It’ task plot. Trend-lines include the participant drawn line (dashed black), the OLS regression line (solid steelblue) and the PA regression line based on the principal axis (solid orange).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Linear Trend Constraint\n\nThe ‘You Draw It’ method does not restrict participants to draw a straight line as other methods would, such as using a ruler. Instead, participants are allowed to freely draw a line with potential curvature. Using the lmer function in the lme4 package (Bates et al. 2015), a linear mixed model (LMM) was fit separately to the OLS residuals and PA residuals, emulating the effect of constraining participants to draw a linear trend. Both fixed and random parameter estimates in the LMM were determined by optimizing the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) through penalized least squares. Parameter choice, \\(x\\), and the interaction between \\(x\\) and the parameter choice were treated as fixed effects with a random participant effect included to account for variation due to participant. The LMM equation for each fit (OLS and PA) is given by: \\[\n\\begin{equation}\ny_{ijk,drawn} - \\hat y_{ijk,fit} = e_{ijk,fit} = \\left[\\gamma_0 + \\alpha_i\\right] + \\left[\\gamma_{1} x_{ijk} + \\gamma_{2i} x_{ijk}\\right] + p_{j} + \\epsilon_{ijk}\n\\end{equation}\\] where\n\n\\(y_{ijk,drawn}\\) is the drawn \\(y\\) value for the \\(i^{th}\\) parameter choice, \\(j^{th}\\) participant, and \\(k^{th}\\) increment of \\(x\\) value\n\\(\\hat y_{ijk,fit}\\) is the fitted \\(y\\) value for the \\(i^{th}\\) parameter choice, \\(j^{th}\\) participant, and \\(k^{th}\\) increment of \\(x\\) value corresponding to either the OLS or PA fit\n\\(e_{ijk,fit}\\) is the residual between the drawn and fitted \\(y\\) values for the \\(i^{th}\\) parameter choice, \\(j^{th}\\) participant, and \\(k^{th}\\) increment of \\(x\\) value corresponding to either the OLS or PA fit\n\\(\\gamma_0\\) is the overall intercept\n\\(\\alpha_i\\) is the effect of the \\(i^{th}\\) parameter choice (S, F, V, N) on the intercept\n\\(\\gamma_1\\) is the overall slope for \\(x\\)\n\\(\\gamma_{2i}\\) is the effect of the parameter choice on the slope\n\\(x_{ijk}\\) is the \\(x\\) value for the \\(i^{th}\\) parameter choice, \\(j^{th}\\) participant, and \\(k^{th}\\) increment\n\\(p_{j} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{participant})\\) is the random error due to the \\(j^{th}\\) participant’s characteristics\n\\(\\epsilon_{ijk} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\) is the residual error.\n\nConstraining the residual trend to a linear fit, Figure 5 shows the estimated trend line of the residuals between the participant drawn points and fitted values for both the OLS regression line and PA regression line. Estimated residual trend lines are overlaid on the observed individual participant residuals. Results indicate the estimated trends of PA residuals (orange) appear to align closer to the \\(y=0\\) horizontal (dashed) line than the OLS residuals (blue). In particular, this trend is more prominent in parameter choices with large variances (F and N). These results are consistent to those found in Mosteller et al. (1981) indicating participants fit a trend-line closer to the estimated regression line with a slope based on the first principal axis than the estimated OLS regression line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Estimated trend line of the residuals between the participant drawn points and fitted values for both the OLS (blue) regression line and PA (orange) regression line constrained to a linear fit modeled by a linear mixed model. Estimated residual trends with 95% confidence bands are overlaid on the observed individual participant residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Smoothing Spline Trend\nEliminating the linear trend constraint, the bam function in the mgcv package (Wood 2017) was used to fit a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) separately to the OLS residuals and PA residuals to allow for estimation of smoothing splines. The bam function is used to fit GAMM’s to very large data sets and use lower memory than the gam function; REML is used to estimate parameters and smoothing splines. Parameter choice was treated as a fixed effect with no estimated intercept and a separate smoothing spline for \\(x\\) was estimated for each parameter choice. A random participant effect was included to account for variation due to participant and a random spline for each participant accounted for variation in spline for each participant. Defining \\(e_{ijk,fit}\\) the same as in equation (2) above, the GAMM equation for each fit (OLS and PA) residuals is given by: \\[\n\\begin{equation}\ne_{ijk,fit} = \\alpha_i + s_{i}(x_{ijk}) + p_{j} + s_{j}(x_{ijk})\n\\end{equation}\n\\] where\n\n\\(e_{ijk,fit}\\) is the same as equation\n\\(\\alpha_i\\) is the intercept for the parameter choice \\(i\\)\n\\(s_{i}\\) is the smoothing spline for the \\(i^{th}\\) parameter choice\n\\(x_{ijk}\\) is the \\(x\\) value for the \\(i^{th}\\) parameter choice, \\(j^{th}\\) participant, and \\(k^{th}\\) increment\n\\(p_{j} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{participant})\\) is the error due to participant variation\n\\(s_{j}\\) is the random smoothing spline for each participant.\n\nAllowing for flexibility in the residual trend, Figure 6 shows the estimated trend line of the residuals between the participant drawn points and fitted values for both the OLS regression line and PA regression line. Estimated residual trends were overlaid on the observed individual participant residuals. The results of the GAMM align with those shown in Figure 5 providing support that estimated trends of PA residuals (orange) appear to align closer to the \\(y=0\\) horizontal (dashed) line than the OLS residuals (blue) for scatterplots with more noise (F and N). By fitting smoothing splines, we can determine whether participants naturally fit a straight trend-line to the set of points or whether they deviate throughout the domain. In particular, in scatterplots with smaller variance (S and V), we can see that participants began at approximately the correct starting point then deviated away from the fitted regression lines and corrected for their fit toward the end of their trend-line. In scatterplots with larger variance (F and N), participants estimated their starting value in the extreme direction of the OLS regression line based on the increasing or decreasing trend but more accurately represented the starting value of the PA regression line. As participants continued their trend-line, they crossed through the OLS regression line indicating they estimated the slope in the extreme direction. These results provide further insight into the curvature humans perceive in a set of points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Estimated trend line of the residuals between the participant drawn points and fitted values for both the OLS (blue) regression line and PA (orange) regression line determined by smoothing splines fit by a generalized additive mixed model. Estimated residual trends with 95% confidence bands are overlaid on the observed individual participant residuals."

Boredom is an emotion commonly reported by students (e.g., Goetz et al., 2014; Mann & Robinson, 2009).\nTopic ID + relatability + importance\nBoredom impedes students’ learning motivation and academic performance (e.g., Pekrun, Goetz, Daniels, Stupnisky, & Perry, 2010; Tze, Daniels, & Klassen, 2016). Whereas much attention has been given to students’ experience of boredom in educational settings, little is known about teachers’ boredom, especially how it might affect students’ boredom and learning experience.\nIdentify the problem and hole in existing work\nThrough experience sampling method, the current study investigated the interplay of teachers’ boredom, students’ perceived teacher boredom, students’ boredom, and students’ learning motivation.\nOccupy the niche – preview the investigation/findings"
