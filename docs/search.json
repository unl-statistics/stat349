In other words, correlation does not imply causation, but it does sometimes ‚Äúimply‚Äù causation."

Of the 59600 questionnaires mailed, 41024 replies were received and 40701 (34494 males and 6207 females) were sufficiently complete to be included in the follow-up. Because of the limited sample size and limited tobacco consumption females were excluded from most reports, and the study has focused on the males.
