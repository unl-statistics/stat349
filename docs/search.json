You should consider both the probability of a coastal -&gt; inland tornadic event and the consequences – a F0 tornado is unlikely to have the power to lift sharks from the water, while an F5 tornado might have the ability to transport many sharks inland. How serious is the sharknado threat to your bottom line?"

The mayor, concerned about the degrading transportation infrastructure in the city, has asked you to assess the risk of bridge failure to the city, after well-publicized bridge collapses in cities on the East Coast in 2024.\nAssemble data from one or more reputable sources (State and national DOT, Army Corps of Engineers, etc.). Assess the risk of a bridge collapse event occurring over the next 5 years, using publicly available data. You should consider both the probability of such a collapse and the consequences – a small county road bridge collapse is less problematic than e.g. the I-80 bridge over the Missouri collapsing. What interventions do you recommend to minimize the risk?"

The power plant is situated along the Gulf of Mexico in Dauphin Island, AL, and uses the Gulf as an heatsink.\nCurrently, the plant is designed around the assumption that the temperature of the gulf will be below 85\\(^\\circ\\)F (this assumption was relatively reasonable when the plant was built in 1970). When the water temperature is above this point, the plant must operate at reduced capacity, as it cannot transfer additional thermal energy into the water.\nAssemble data from one or more reputable sources (USGS, NOAA, US Energy Information Administration). Make an operational assessment of the risk that the plant will have to operate at reduced capacity during the next 5 years. Consider both the probability of reduced operating capacity as well as the timing of that capacity (e.g. you should also look at electrical usage during those periods)."

You can customize it later.\nOn GitHub, set your site to render to the docs directory (detailed instructions).\n\nChange your _quarto.yml file to have output-dir: docs\nCreate an empty .nojekyll file in the main directory of your project repository\nConfigure your GitHub repository (Settings -&gt; Pages -&gt; Build and Deployment) to publish the /docs directory of the main branch of your repository.\n\nCheck the rendered site (it should have an address of https://.github.io/portfolio) – it may take ~5 minutes to appear after you’ve completed step 4.\nMake any tweaks to your site that you’d like to make – add pictures, a biography, posts about your interests, etc.\n\nThe goal of this is to have a place where you can showcase your coursework for future employers. Keep it professional (but it’s ok to have some information about your hobbies, if you want to show that dimension of yourself).\nThe department may eventually want to showcase some of these sites so that incoming students can see what current students accomplish as part of our courses. We will ask permission first!\n\n\n\n\nUpdating your site\nRendering your site will be done manually – thus, each time you want to update the actual site, you’ll have to run the following commands in the terminal (not the R console):\nquarto render\ngit add docs\ngit commit -m \"Publish site to docs/\"\ngit push\n(You can also accomplish this by hitting the Render button in RStudio and then adding and committing the docs folder in the git pane in RStudio.)\nIf you’re feeling fancy, you can automate this process using a GitHub action, but this is fiddly and probably not worth it unless you’re actually planning to use this as a blog and update it frequently. If you decide to set everything up with Github Actions, I can offer a minimal amount of help with debugging, but even I find them confusing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRendering your site\n\n\n\nUpdating the markdown files is not enough – you have to render (in e.g. RStudio) and push the docs folder for changes to show up on Github pages.\nIf things aren’t working,\n\nRun render via RStudio or by using quarto render . on the command line (in the project folder).\nLook for any un-pushed changes, either in the Git pane of RStudio (hit refresh) or by running git status on the command line.\nCheck that the docs/ folder has been committed AND pushed to GitHub.\nAsk for help, either in class during some downtime, or by making an office hours appointment."
