    "text": "Steps\n\nCreate a github repository that is named “portfolio” and located at https://github.com/%3Cusername%3E/portfolio\nCreate a quarto website (I recommend a blog – it will make it easier to keep track of when things are updated) by following these directions.\nSet your site up to render to the docs directory (detailed instructions).\n\nChange your _quarto.yml file to have output-dir: docs\nCreate an empty .nojekyll file in the main directory of your project repository\nConfigure your GitHub repository (Settings -&gt; Pages -&gt; Build and Deployment) to publish the /docs directory of the main branch of your repository.\n\n\nRendering your site will be done manually – thus, each time you want to update the actual site, you’ll have to run the following commands in the terminal (not the R console):\nquarto render\ngit add docs\ngit commit -m \"Publish site to docs/\"\ngit push\n(You can also accomplish this by hitting the Render button in RStudio and then adding and committing the docs folder in the git pane in RStudio.)\nIf you’re feeling fancy, you can automate this process using a GitHub action, but this is fiddly and probably not worth it unless you’re actually planning to use this as a blog and update it frequently. If you decide to set everything up with Github Actions, that is fine, but I can only offer a minimal amount of help with debugging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRendering your site\n\n\n\nUpdating the markdown files is not enough – you have to render and push the docs folder for changes to show up on the site.\nIf things aren’t working, double check that running Render doesn’t change anything in the Git pane, and then check that the docs/ folder has been committed AND pushed to GitHub."

    "text": "You are an analyst for an insurance agency concerned with increasing payouts for property damage with a warming climate. Your boss recently saw Sharknado (2013) while trying to battle insomnia, and has become concerned about the increased likelihood of shark-infested weather as severe weather events become more probable due to climate change.\nYour boss’s concerns about the possiblity of shark-infested storms cannot be countered with logic, but you might be able to convince them that very few storms even have shark-infestation potential.\nAssemble data from one or more reputable sources (NOAA, USGS, etc.).\nAssess the probability that tornadoes form in coastal areas (Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico) and move inward, compared to the probability that tornadoes form inland and move toward the coast. You should consider both the probability of a coastal -&gt; inland tornadic event and the consequences – a F0 tornado is unlikely to have the power to lift sharks from the water, while an F5 tornado might have the ability to transport many sharks inland. How serious is the sharknado threat to your bottom line?"

Assess the risk of a bridge collapse event occurring over the next 5 years, using publicly available data. You should consider both the probability of such a collapse and the consequences – a small county road bridge collapse is less problematic than e.g. the I-80 bridge over the Missouri collapsing. What interventions do you recommend to minimize the risk?"

The power plant is situated along the Gulf of Mexico in Dauphin Island, AL, and uses the Gulf as an heatsink.\nCurrently, the plant is designed around the assumption that the temperature of the gulf will be below 85\\(^\\circ\\)F (this assumption was relatively reasonable when the plant was built in 1970). When the water temperature is above this point, the plant must operate at reduced capacity, as it cannot transfer additional thermal energy into the water.\nAssemble data from one or more reputable sources (USGS, NOAA, US Energy Information Administration). Make an operational assessment of the risk that the plant will have to operate at reduced capacity during the next 5 years. Consider both the probability of reduced operating capacity as well as the timing of that capacity (e.g. you should also look at electrical usage during those periods)."
