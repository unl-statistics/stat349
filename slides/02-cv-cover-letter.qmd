## Resume vs. CV ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

- RÃ©sumÃ©: short career summary
    - standard for non academic jobs
    - 1 page (2 for longer career)
- CV: exhaustive list of everything you've done
    - academic/research oriented jobs, grad school
    - as many pages as necessary

## Activity: Data Science Resumes

```{r, results='asis'}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
files <- list.files("../files/resume-examples/", "*.pdf", full.names = T)
filenames <- list.files("../files/resume-examples/", "*.pdf", full.names = F)

library(stringr)

filenames <- filenames |>
  str_remove("-resume-example.pdf") |>
  str_replace_all("-", " ") |>
  str_to_title()

library(glue)

purrr::map2_chr(filenames, files, ~glue("[{filename}]({file})", filename = .x, file = .y)) |> knitr::kable(col.names = NULL)
```

What works? What doesn't?
