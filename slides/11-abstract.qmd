## Types of Abstracts

According to [OTC](https://alg.manifoldapp.org/read/open-technical-communication/section/a31e38b4-7f1f-4e9c-b8e9-9485d74d04b8), 

- Descriptive Abstracts
    - very short (1-2 sentences)
    - "teaser" of contents without any details or conclusions

- Informative Abstracts
    - Contains key facts and conclusions
    - Contains components of each major section of the report
    - 10% of the length of the report or 2-3 pages, whichever is shorter
    

## Types of Abstracts

I have never seen either type of abstract used in scientific articles.

Some government reports might use Informative Abstracts (but Exec Summary is more common)

## Abstracts

From "The Scientific Guide to Writing" [@heardScientistsGuideWriting2022]

- Abstracts were rare before 1920s, not routine until 1950s    
[None of the papers I have for this class from even the 1960s has an abstract]{.purple .emph}
- Widely available (even when paper is not) and searchable
  - helps others find your research
- Mini IMRaD (Intro, Methods, Results, and Discussion) structure
  - in Medicine, abstracts even have sections that make these pieces easier to find
  - longer abstracts = better discovery by e.g. Google. 

## Abstracts

- Follow journal style
  - Structure
  - Word limits
- Must be self-contained 
  - usually no citations
  - no references to figure/table
  - try not to use acronyms

- Some are afraid of "spoilers" -- don't worry about this in the abstract.

- Can optimize abstracts to include keywords to help with search engine discovery.

## Other considerations

- Use active voice

- Avoid non-alphanumeric characters (greek letters, unicode, etc.) because these can cause issues in databases

- Don't try to include secondary results unless you have no word limit



## Practical Advice

- Draft abstract
  - first and last sentence of each section in the paper 
  - main idea of each section in the paper


- Then, refine and make it make sense from there

## Activity

Without looking at the abstract of your IgNobel paper (if there is one), write a short 5-6 sentence abstract for the paper. 

Trade with a friend and compare their abstract to their paper (and/or the paper's abstract if it exists)
