```{{r}}
# code that does something fun
```

## Don't run the code if it's installing a package!

````
```{{r, eval = F}}
# The most evil R package ever
remotes::install_github("romainfrancois/evil.R") 
```
````

## Include results in nice tables

```{r, messages = F, echo = T}
library(knitr)
data(mtcars)
kable(head(mtcars))
```

## References {.r-fit-text}

@refname1 said that you should "stay on the sunny side, always on the sunny side", which has been validated in other studies [@refname2; @refname3]
```

::: column
### In your refs.bib file...

```

@misc{refname1,
	title = {Keep on the sunny Side},
  year = {1899},
  author = {Blenkhorn, Ada}
}

@book{refname2,
  title = {O Brother Where Art Thou},
  author = {The Whites},
  year = 2000
}

@book{refname3,
  title = {Keep on the Sunny Side},
  author = {The Carter Family},
  year = 1964
}
```

You may have to check Zotero's work -- webpages often don't have dates zotero detects.

Look for the 'last updated' date if all else fails.

## Basic Formatting

- `#` = primary section subdivision (chapter for books, etc.)
- `##` = subsections
- `###` = subsubsections

Never use more than one additional # in a sub-section!!


In book projects, `#` headings are reserved for chapters, which are usually in separate files. Sections (`##`) and Subsections (`###`) only occur within chapters.  

## Quarto projects

`_quarto.yml` file contains project-wide metadata

- Title
- Author(s)
- Abstract
- Bibliography

You really need to fill this in!


## Callouts

::: {.callout-tip}
### Title of callout 

Callouts are really cool ways to call attention to important information. There are multiple styles that each have their own colors and icons. 

:::

You can get a callout by:

````
::: {.callout-tip}

### Title of callout

Inside text

:::
````

::: {.callout-warning}
You can even get callouts without titles by just omitting the title and title header. This is a `.callout-warning`
:::

::: {.callout-caution}
This is a `.callout-caution`
:::

::: {.callout-note}
This is a `.callout-note`
:::


## Formatting is Important!

If your report doesn't have a proper title, or you haven't bothered to fill in your name as author, it's hard to take the rest of the report seriously!

[Quarto Book documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/books/book-structure.html) may help you with your business report.

[Authoring documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) covers a lot of useful information -- embedding pictures, videos, code annotation, tables, and more.
