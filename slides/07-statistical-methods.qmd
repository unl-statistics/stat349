## Key components

- Study design and data collection

- Setting - location, timeframe, recruitment/inclusion criteria

- Sampling method

- Variables collected (and any derived variables)

- Statistical analysis methods

## Example: Polio Vaccine Trial

[Annotated paper](../instructions/methods-papers/1954FieldTrial.qmd)

- National trial of Polio vaccines

- 2 strategies: 
    - vaccinate 2nd grade, with 1st and 3rd as controls
    - double-blind placebo trial in 1st-3rd grades
    
- Compare enrolled children who didn't get the vaccine to those who did
    - Explicitly not comparing unenrolled children (SES differences)

## Observations: Polio Vaccine Trial Report

- What works?

- What could be improved?

## Observations: Polio Vaccine Trial Report

- Is it clearly written?

- Is it well organized?



## Example: Signs of the Sine Illusion

[Annotated paper](../instructions/methods-papers/sine-illusion.qmd)


- Goal was to show that the sine illusion is both theoretically and practically impactful in graphics

- First part of the paper shows how the illusion works and provides examples of how it impacts statistical judgment

- Second part of the paper contains a user study

Disclaimer: This was my first first-author paper. 

Feel free to critique, because... it was 10 years ago and I hope I've improved my writing since then.

## Example: Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era

[Annotated paper](../instructions/methods-papers/Eye-Fitting-Straight-Lines-in-the-Modern-Era.qmd)

- Goal was to validate a new method for collecting eye-fitted regression data online

- Secondary goal was to examine eye-fit regressions compared to linear regressions and principal component analysis

## Documenting your code

- State any critical assumptions about data format
    - e.g. columns named ..., observations in rows, ...
    - Assumed range of values

- Record package versions from the final analysis -- `renv` is a good way to do this

- Use comments to clearly describe the goal of the code
