- For Wednesday: Submit a topic idea for your user guide

  - Focus on practical implementation

- Example: Conducting visual inference studies using the `nullabor` package

## Removing the Training Wheels

- Thesis developed in parallel with the body of the essay

- Feedback loop:
  - initial thesis -> draft of the body
  - discoveries while drafting the body -> update thesis
  - updated thesis -> reshape the body
  
 
## Removing the Training Wheels

- Continual refining of ideas until
  - you're happy    
  (OR)
  - the due date arrives
  

## Statistical Writing

Main types of statistical writing (in my experience):

- Experiment write-up

- White paper/Technical report
    - Use a statistical analysis to make a point

- Tutorial

- Literature review




## Organizing Information

- Make a list of the main points

- Make lists of supporting information for each main point


- Move them around (Post its!) to see if you can find natural transitions
    - time
    - connecting pieces of information
    - logical flow
    



## Organizing Information


- If things don't logically connect
    - are you missing critical pieces to connect concepts? -> More research
    - are you trying to do too much? -> Narrow topic/thesis



## Activity

Build the document using the puzzle pieces I've given you. 

Can you make them logically connect?

What features are you using to connect each piece?
