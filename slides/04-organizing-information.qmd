## Before you start

- Doing it right will take more time than you think!

- AI summaries miss technical context and important points

## Basic Structure {.r-fit-text}

Scientific articles mostly follow this structure:

- Abstract
- Introduction
- Methods
- Results
- Conclusions/Discussion
- References
- Appendices/Supplementary Information



## Basic Structure {.r-fit-text}

Scientific articles mostly follow this structure:

+----------------+--------------------------------------------+ 
| Abstract       | Very technical and concise                 |
+----------------+--------------------------------------------+  
| Introduction   | Definitions and context, motivation        | 
+----------------+--------------------------------------------+ 
| Methods        | Data collection, some statistics           | 
+----------------+--------------------------------------------+ 
| Results        | Interpretation/significance tests          | 
+----------------+--------------------------------------------+ 
| Discussion/    | What does it mean?                         |
| Conclusion     | Why does it matter?                        |
+----------------+--------------------------------------------+ 
| References     | What work is this related to?              | 
|                | How well established are the methods?      |
+----------------+--------------------------------------------+
| Supplement     | Code, data, stuff reviewers wanted,        |
|                | things that didn't fit page limit...       |
+----------------+--------------------------------------------+


## Basic Structure {.r-fit-text}

Technical reports have a more varied structure:

- Executive Summary
- Contents

- Introduction
- Body - broken into sections
- Conclusions

- References/Bibliography

- Appendices




## Basic Structure {.r-fit-text}

Technical reports have a more varied structure:

- Executive Summary [(for dummies)]{.emph .cerulean}
- Contents [preview of what you're in for]{.emph .cerulean}

- Introduction
- Body - broken into sections
- Conclusions

- References/Bibliography

- Appendices [technical documentation, related documents, stuff to ~~bury so management doesn't see it~~ CYA]{.emph .cerulean}



## Strategy 1: Spoilers!

## Strategy 1: ü´£ Spoilers!

### First Pass

- Read the title

- Read the conclusion
    - Assemble a couple of questions to focus your reading

- Skim the methods

- Skim the results

Can you answer your assembled questions?


## Strategy 1: ü´£ Spoilers!

### Think a bit

What do you not understand (yet)?

  - Vocabulary? Google/Dictionary/Reference book

  - How they came to the conclusion?
  
      - Read the paper again, in order this time
      
  - Why this topic is interesting?
      - Read the introduction... 
      [(if this doesn't help, just accept that it's interesting to someone)]{.small}

## Strategy 1: ü´£ Spoilers!

### Read it again

- üîù In order, this time

- üé∂Ô∏è Margin notes - ask questions (for you or the author)!

- Liberally comment 
    - ‚ÅâÔ∏è/üî•/ü§°/ü§Ø/ü™ø
    - "this is cool/dumb/nonsenscical"
    - WTF

- ‚úèÔ∏è Highlight/underline key points, definitions that are new to you    
[highlighting everything doesn't work that well - be selective!]{.small}


## Strategy 1: ü´£ Spoilers!

### ‚úÖ  Check your understanding

- Abstract - teaser for the full paper

  - Highlights important points (most of the time)
  - Highlights motivation (some of the time)
  - Presents key results
  
  Make sure you understand at least what the abstract covers
  

- Conclusion

  - Do you understand how/why the authors came to their conclusions?
  
  - How does this paper fit into the wider field?
  
## Strategy 2: Outline/Sketch

- Read the introduction (NOT the abstract)
  
  - Identify the big question
  
  - Summarize the background in <5 sentences

Strategy 2 from https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2016/05/09/how-to-read-and-understand-a-scientific-paper-a-guide-for-non-scientists/
:::

## Strategy 2: Outline/Sketch

- Read the methods

  - Identify the specific question(s)
  
  - Identify the approach
  
  - Draw a diagram (for experiments) showing process/methods


## Strategy 2: Outline/Sketch

- Read the results

  - Summarize results for each experiment
  
  - Do results answer the specific question(s)?
  
- Read the conclusion/discussion

  - What contribution does this make?
  
  - What follow-up experiments are necessary?


## Strategy 2: Outline/Sketch

- Read the abstract

- What do other researchers say about this paper?

    - Look for citations to the paper that are relatively close in time
    - Locate where the paper was cited
    - See if opinions are offered
    

## Evaluating the paper
### Other Details

- Authors, institutional affiliations

    - are there likely biases here?
    
- Journal

    - Check [journal rankings](https://wos-journal.info/)

## Technical/Business Reports

- Look at charts/pictures

- Read conclusions

- Look at tables

- Read the report

- Read the executive summary

    - üé≠ü¶ô: Compare/contrast with the rest of the report
    
# Writing a Summary

- State the motivation/research question
    - Why is this interesting/important?

- What hypotheses were tested? What solutions were considered?

- What methods/experimental designs were used?

- What were the results? Significance?

- Why does it matter? What is the implication?
    - Don't overstate
    - Include caveats if applicable
    
## Revising a Summary

- Read your summary out loud (or have the computer read it to you)
  - Is anything not logically clear? 
    - Listen for "non sequiturs" (it does not follow) and missing sentences
  - Grammar/clarity check

- Re-read/skim the article again

- Read your summary after you revisit the article
  - Did you cover all of the important points?
  
  - What assumptions did you make about your audience?
  
## Summary Style Guide

- Eliminate wordiness    
[extra adverbs ("clearly", "very", "mostly") and weasel words should go]{.small}

- Use specific language    
["this experiment illustrates" instead of "this illustrates"]{.small}

- Accurate language    
["fail to reject" instead of "support for the null"]{.small}

- Don't use direct quotes -- summaries are more concise than the original

[Ask yourself "Do I need this word?"]{.emph .cerulean .huge}
