## Bayesian Modeling Workflow

![Image source: [Building energy statistical modeling](https://buildingenergygeeks.org/index.html) ch. 3](images/bayesian-model-workflow.png){fig-alt="A workflow diagram for bayesian modeling. Step 1: setting up a probability model, with model and prior specifications. Prior predictive checking. This may result in sensitivity/identifiability preliminary analyses before continuing to step 2. Step 2: Learning. Calibration and convergence diagnostics.  Step 3: Model checking and validation, including residual analysis and posterior predictive model checks. This leads to estimation of prediction accuracy and interpretation of parameter values."}

## Scikit Learn estimator workflow
