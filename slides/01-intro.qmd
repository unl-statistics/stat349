# Syllabus Policies

## Class Structure

- More lecture based than previous classes with me... but lots of activities
- Lots of reading/writing practice
- Scaffolding for projects - practice on a section, then add to your final project

- Policy subject to good-faith use and my availability

- Resubmissions will be graded at my leisure. DO NOT email me asking about the resubmission unless it has been at least 2 weeks. 

## Keep Up With The Work!

::: incremental

- Learning good writing skills requires time and practice. 


- If you wait until the last minute to write, you can't revise and practice.

- This course is paced to give you enough time to revise your work... intentionally.

:::

## Projects

- Scaffolded with homework assignments

- Fix things I comment on w/ homework!

- Late work will NOT be accepted without 
    - major life events of >2 week duration AND 
    - evidence of engagement with the assignment before the event occurred
    
- Project presentations will be scheduled during Week 15 and Finals
    - IF presentations get done during Week 15 then we won't meet for the final

- Do NOT make travel plans for the end of the semester

## User Guide

- Translate a statistics topic into a practical guide for how to do something
    - What is required to begin? data, etc.
    - What steps need to be taken?
    - How should the results be presented/interpreted?

- Practice thinking about audience needs and planning scope
    - Think about trying to learn a package based on a sparse vignette that doesn't address your use case... and prevent that.
    
- Takes more time to understand the topic than you think -- start early. 

- Rough Draft due `r format(due_dates |> filter(name=="User Guide Draft") |> magrittr::extract2("date"), "%B %e")` at 6pm

- Final version due `r format(due_dates |> filter(name=="User Guide") |> magrittr::extract2("date"), "%B %e")` at 6pm



## Business Report

- Address a statistical question of interest to a business
    - Most of these are somewhat based on my time in industry

- Find and document relevant data

- Explain and document your analysis

- Draw a conclusion and explain that to a non-statistician

- Make a presentation

- Rough Draft due `r format(due_dates |> filter(name=="Business Report Draft") |> magrittr::extract2("date"), "%B %e")` at 6pm

- Final written report due `r format(due_dates |> filter(name=="Business Report") |> magrittr::extract2("date"), "%B %e")` at 6pm

- Presentations in-class `r paste(paste(format(due_dates |> filter(name=="Business Report Presentations") |> magrittr::extract2("date"), "%B %e"), collapse = ", "), " (if necessary)", sep = "")`

## Evaluation Criteria

In addition to the rubric:

- Grammar and spelling
- Ability to communicate effectively
- Intellectual engagement 
- Demonstrated understanding of the material

Simple, elegant solutions > unnecessary complexity

## AI
::: incremental

- The goal of writing classes is to improve your ability to reason... the writing is a side effect

-  AI cannot think/explain/reason -- it only predicts the next likely word probabilistically

- Do NOT use AI as a replacement for doing work. Querying to explore your understanding is probably fine, using it to write or think for you is not. 

- I would rather read something with typos and grammar issues than something that sounds like it's from AI and not your thoughts. 

:::

## Evaluation Criteria

**Any use of generative AI must be disclosed** in an appendix to your submission

You must document the following:

-   the version of the generative AI used (e.g. Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT 5.2, Copilot GPT-5 chat)
-   the full sequence of prompts and responses
-   any additional inputs you provided to the AI system (documents, images, etc.)
-   a "diff" between the AI responses and your submission, showing exactly what was generated by the AI system and what you changed. 

## Oral Exams

- Be prepared to explain your writing process, your approach, and your code

- Oral exams on the assignment can be used to replace the assignment grade at my discretion

    - This is not intended as punishment -- it helps at least as often as it hurts

- Policy applies to homework and projects
