## Project Life Cycle

## Problem Definition

**Trouble** - what does the project aim to solve?

**Owner** - who owns the problem? (business, stakeholders)

**Success** - what are the success criteria?

**Constraints** - logistical, budgetary, time...?

**Actors** - stakeholders and their interests

**References** - how have similar problems been solved in the past?


## Example: University Enrollment

Costs of running a university are increasing, but the Board of Regents will not authorize tuition increases; as a result, UNL needs to recruit more students in order to continue to function as a state flagship university. 

- Trouble?

- Owner?

- Success criteria?

- Constraints?

- Actors?

- References?


## Writing the Problem Statement

- Business problem -> general statement

- Temporally focused
- Incorporate constraints
- Written to engage actors
- Has to work within owner's constraints

## Example: University Enrollment

UNL needs to increase enrollment by 1% per year to offset cost increases due to inflation and reduce the need for tuition increases which would further strain Nebraskans' budgets.


## Break into Smaller Problems

- Decomposition:     
What factors contribute to enrollment gains/losses?

- Partition the space: mutually exclusive sub-problems    
Recruitment, Retention, Registration


## Convert Small Problems into Data Problems

- What data do we have?

- What data do we need?

- Is it feasible to do the analysis with the resources available?

- How complex is the analysis?
