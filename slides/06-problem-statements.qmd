## Project Life Cycle

![[Image source](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/crafting-effective-problem-statements-for-data-science-projects-60c979642194): levelup.gitconnected.com](images/data-science-lifecycle.png){fig-alt="Data science project lifecycle: Problem definition, hypothesis generation, data extraction/collection, data exploration/transformation, model building, model deployment"}

## Problem Definition

**Trouble** - what does the project aim to solve?

**Owner** - who owns the problem? (business, stakeholders)

**Success** - what are the success criteria?

**Constraints** - logistical, budgetary, time...?

**Actors** - stakeholders and their interests

**References** - how have similar problems been solved in the past?


## Example: University Enrollment

Costs of running a university are increasing, but the Board of Regents will not authorize tuition increases; as a result, UNL needs to recruit more students in order to continue to function as a state flagship university. 

- Trouble?

- Owner?

- Success criteria?

- Constraints?

- Actors?

- References?


## Writing the Problem Statement

- Business problem -> general statement

- Temporally focused
- Incorporate constraints
- Written to engage actors
- Has to work within owner's constraints

## Example: University Enrollment

UNL needs to increase enrollment by 1% per year to offset cost increases due to inflation and reduce the need for tuition increases which would further strain Nebraskans' budgets.


## Break into Smaller Problems

- Decomposition:     
What factors contribute to enrollment gains/losses?

- Partition the space: mutually exclusive sub-problems    
Recruitment, Retention, Registration


## Convert Small Problems into Data Problems

- What data do we have?

- What data do we need?

- Is it feasible to do the analysis with the resources available?

- How complex is the analysis?

## Activity

- Pick a problem statement

- Refine the problem statement

- Swap with a classmate who selected a different statement

- Peer review the refined problem statements

- Share with the class

## Problem statement topics

A. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is concerned that a concrete barrier will be picked up in a tornado and blown into a reactor building. Is this an issue that is sufficiently probable to address via changes to plant design?

B. Firearms and Toolmark (FATM) Examiners claim that subjective examination has an error rate of 2%, but the studies establishing this rate are unreliable. Do FATM examiners use methods which are sufficiently reliable to be presented in court?

C. One brand of vaccine requires one shot and has an 80% efficacy rate, while another brand requires two shots and has a 95% efficacy rate. Public Health officials want to know which shot has a better chance of stopping a global pandemic.
