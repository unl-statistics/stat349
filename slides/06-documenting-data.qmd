## What are the critical components of data documentation?

- Who collected the data
- Why the data was collected
- What the data is about
- When the data was collected
- Where the data was collected
- How the data was generated/collected
- Structure of the data
- Formatting decisions in the data
- Data validation/quality control
- How the data can be reused/license
- Suggested data analysis methods
- Measurement instruments used


## Documentation is Project Dependent

### Project 1: Building a Shoe Print Wear Database

  - 150 pairs of shoes
  - 2 brands of shoes
  - several sizes for each brand
  - step counters used on the shoes
  - questionnaires measuring activities 
  - wearer weight/height/gait

---

### Shoe Measurements

Initial measurement period + 2-3 additional measurement periods (~6 weeks between)

  - Photos of shoe soles
  - Digital shoe sole prints
  - Powder prints
    - Film
    - Paper
    - Vinyl flooring
  - 3d scans of shoe soles
  
Measurements taken in the lab by research assistants.

## Important Documentation?

- Probably should have included which research assistant was wearing the shoe, how much they weighed, their gait/height/etc., and so on.

Whoops.

## Documentation is Project Dependent

### Project 2: Wire cuts

- Goal is to estimate the length of sharp surfaces on all wire-cutting tool in peoples' homes
- General survey with instructions for measuring each type of tool
- Collected data is a list of tool types, # blades, # cutting surfaces, and # of that tool

- Estimates are generated by adding up total length of cutting surfaces

## Data Doc Influences Analysis

- Experimental design
- Randomization
- Sampling strategy
- Random effects
- Transformations of collected data
- Sources of measurement error

- [DDI Alliance](https://ddialliance.org/) - probably overkill but in a good way

- Data Librarians are amazing to work with
