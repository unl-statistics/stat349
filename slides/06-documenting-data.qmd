## What are the critical components of data documentation?

- Who collected the data
- Why the data was collected
- What the data is about
- When the data was collected
- Where the data was collected
- How the data was generated/collected
- Structure of the data
- Formatting decisions in the data
- Data validation/quality control
- How the data can be reused/license
- Suggested data analysis methods
- Measurement instruments used


## Documentation is Project Dependent

### Project 1: Building a Shoe Print Wear Database

  - 150 pairs of shoes
  - 2 brands of shoes
  - several sizes for each brand
  - step counters used on the shoes
  - questionnaires measuring activities 
  - wearer weight/height/gait

---

### Shoe Measurements

Initial measurement period + 2-3 additional measurement periods (~6 weeks between)

  - Photos of shoe soles
  - Digital shoe sole prints
  - Powder prints
    - Film
    - Paper
    - Vinyl flooring
  - 3d scans of shoe soles
  
Measurements taken in the lab by research assistants.

## Important Documentation?

- See all of the metadata [here](https://github.com/CSAFE-ISU/Longitudinal_Shoe_Study)

::: fragment

- Probably should have included which research assistant was wearing the shoe, how much they weighed, their gait/height/etc., and so on.

Whoops.

## Documentation is Project Dependent

### Project 2: Wire cuts

- Goal is to estimate the length of sharp surfaces on all wire-cutting tool in peoples' homes
- General survey with instructions for measuring each type of tool
- Collected data is a list of 
    - tool types, 
    - \# blades on the tool, 
    - \# cutting surfaces, 
    - blade length, and 
    - \# of that type of tool

- Estimates are generated by adding up total length of cutting surfaces

## Important Documentation?

- What tools would the participant use to cut a wire typically?
- What tools would they use in a pinch?

- Is participant a professional craftsperson? hobbyist? not handy at all?

- How was blade length measured?


::: fragment

- ... I haven't run this study yet. But I got over 980 cm of cutting surface in my garage/house and my dad got over 2200 cm.

## Codebooks

Basic documentation that contains:

- Variable name in the code
- Long-form description of what was measured
- Units of measurement
- Acceptable values
- Values used to indicate missingness, refusal to respond, etc.
- Additional notes that may be relevant

Very common for government data - CDC codebooks are *intense*. 

## Data Doc Influences Analysis

- Experimental design
- Randomization
- Sampling strategy
- Random effects
- Transformations of collected data
- Sources of measurement error

## Additional Resources

- [DDI Alliance](https://ddialliance.org/) - probably overkill but in a good way

- Data Librarians are amazing to work with
