# General Statistical Misconceptions

## General Statistical Misconception Examples

@motulskyCommonMisconceptionsData2014

- Correlation => Causation

- Linear regression is the only regression

- Small p-value = big effect size

- $R^2$ must be $>0.95$ to matter


## Correlation and Causation

@gershmanCausalImplicaturesCorrelational2023

- People infer causation from correlational statements, using the variable order as a directional indicator

  - Even with "X is associated with an increased risk of Y" language
  - Even when given the choice of non-causal interpretations, 47% of people still use causal interpretations
  
> In summary, certain correlational statements are associated with an increased probability of causal implicature. To be clear, we are not implying that these correlational statements cause causal implicature, but rather that they are correlated with causal implicature. In other words, correlation does not imply causation, but it does sometimes “imply” causation.

- linear regression isn't the right tool for this

- have you considered other explanations?

## P-values

Misconception: Small p-value => Bigger effect size

T-test between $x_1 \sim N(0, 1)$ and $x_2 \sim N(1, 1)$

True $\mu_2-\mu_1 = 1$, $\eta = 1$

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: Two histograms showing p-values for 500 simulations of 50 samples per group, with a mean difference between groups of 0 (left) and 1 (right). On the left, the p-values are approximately uniformly distributed, with 0-10 observations for each of 100 bars. On the right, almost all observations are in the left-most bucket corresponding to [0, 0.01]. 
library(infer)
library(broom)

gen_data <- function(delta=1, sd1=1, sd2=1, n1=50, n2=50) {
  df <- tibble(
    group = rep(1:2, c(n1, n2)),
    obs = c(rnorm(n1, sd = sd1), rnorm(n2, delta, sd2)))
  ttest <- t.test(data = df, obs ~ group)
  effect_size <- delta/sqrt((sd1^2+sd2^2)/2)
  return(tibble(true_d = delta, effect_size = effect_size, data = list(df),  tidy(ttest)))
}

set.seed(20394802)
sim_data <- bind_rows(
  replicate(500, gen_data(delta = 0), simplify = F) ,
  replicate(500, gen_data(), simplify = F), 
  replicate(500, gen_data(delta = .5, sd1 = .5, sd2 = .5), simplify = F)
)


ggplot(filter(sim_data, true_d %in% c(0, 1)), aes(x = p.value)) + 
  facet_wrap(~true_d, labeller = label_both) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 100) + 
  ylab("# Simulations") + xlab("P value, 2 sample t-test")
```

## P-values

Misconception: Small p-value => Bigger effect size


T-test between $x_1 \sim N(0, 0.5)$ and $x_2 \sim N(0.5, 0.5)$

True $\mu_2-\mu_1 = 0.5$, $\eta = 1$

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: Two histograms showing p-values for 500 simulations of 50 samples per group, with a mean difference between groups of 0 (left) and 2 (right). On the left, the p-values are approximately uniformly distributed, with 0-10 observations for each of 100 bars. On the right, all observations are in the left-most bucket corresponding to [0, 0.01]. 

ggplot(filter(sim_data, true_d > 0), aes(x = p.value)) + 
  facet_wrap(~true_d, labeller = label_both) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ylab("# Simulations") + 
  xlab("P value, 2 sample t-test")
```


## R^2

- As number of predictors increases in multiple regression, $R^2$ only increases. Adjusted $R^2$ accounts for this issue.

- Good $R^2$ are different for different fields...


```{r}
library(mvtnorm)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
data <- bind_rows(
    tibble(discipline = "Genetics", alpha = .25, data = as.data.frame(rmvnorm(60, sigma = matrix(c(1, .000001, .000001, 1), nrow = 2)))) |> unnest("data"),
    tibble(discipline = "Finance", alpha = .25, data = as.data.frame(rmvnorm(60, sigma = matrix(c(1, .0001, .0001, 1), nrow = 2)))) |> unnest("data"),
  tibble(discipline = "Medicine", alpha = 0.05, data = as.data.frame(rmvnorm(500, sigma = matrix(c(1, .38, .38, 1), nrow = 2)))) |> unnest("data"),
  tibble(discipline = "Psychology", alpha = 0.25, data = as.data.frame(rmvnorm(100, sigma = matrix(c(1, .7, .7, 1), nrow = 2)))) |> unnest("data"),
  tibble(discipline = "Engineering", alpha = 0.25, data = as.data.frame(rmvnorm(50, sigma = matrix(c(1, .995, .995, 1), nrow = 2)))) |> unnest("data")
)

r2 <- data |> group_by(discipline) |>
  summarize(r2 = cor(V1, V2)^2) |>
  mutate(V1 = 3.5, V2 = -3.5, alpha = 1, label = sprintf("R^2 == %.3f", r2)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  arrange(r2, decreasing = T)

data <- data |>
  mutate(discipline = factor(discipline, levels = r2$discipline, ordered = T))



ggplot(data = data, aes(x = V1, y = V2, alpha = alpha)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~discipline, ncol = 5) + geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  geom_text(data = r2, aes(label = label), hjust = 1.1, vjust = -0.1, parse = T) + 
  scale_alpha_identity() +
  coord_fixed() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.title = element_blank()) + 
  ggtitle(str2expression(paste("Good~", "R^2", "values~by~Discipline", sep = "~")))

```

## R^2


- $R^2$ only measures linear relationships

- Not all interesting relationships are linear

```{r}
library(datasauRus)
data("datasaurus_dozen")
data <- datasaurus_dozen |> filter(dataset == "dino")

ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  coord_fixed() + theme_minimal() + 
  theme(axis.title = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank())
```

# SME Misconceptions

[@rothman2014]

-   Randomized trials are more valid than cohort or case-control studies

-   Study subjects must be a representative sample of the target population for generalizations to be made

-   Lack of statistical interaction = lack of biological interaction

-   Categorizing a continuous variable by percentiles is a good idea

-   Significance testing is the best way to report results




## Randomized Trials

-   Randomized trials still have divergent results

    -   random error

    -   systematic errors (bias) - undercounting, missing data, non-adherence (e.g. medical studies)

-   Well-controlled cohort studies have some advantages:

    -   age control

    -   time since diagnosis of a condition may be better controlled

Simpson's paradox can explain a lot of these issues!

Failure to account for moderating variables can lead to the opposite (wrong) conclusion!

## Representative Samples

> The British Doctors Study, which began in 1951, was the world’s first large prospective study of the effects of smoking to establish a convincing linkage between tobacco smoking and cause-specific mortality, and demonstrated prospectively the risk of death from lung cancer (1954) and myocardial infarction and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1956).
>
> In October 1951, Sir Richard Doll and Sir Austin Bradford Hill sent a questionnaire on smoking habits to all registered British doctors. Of the 59600 questionnaires mailed, 41024 replies were received and 40701 (34494 males and 6207 females) were sufficiently complete to be included in the follow-up. Because of the limited sample size and limited tobacco consumption females were excluded from most reports, and the study has focused on the males.

## Representative Samples

[**Scientific**]{.emph .cerulean} generalization vs. [**Statistical**]{.emph .cerulean} generalization

- Science goal: Make correct statements about the way nature works

- Statistics goal: Extrapolate from a sample to the source population

[These goals may align, but they may not!]{.fragment}


[Whether a sample is representative [**enough**]{.emph .blue} to generalize beyond the sample population is [determined by your argument.]{.emph .red}]{.fragment}


## Representative Samples


$$\left(\begin{array}{c}\text{limiting confounding variables}\\ \text{non-representative population}\end{array}\right) \overset{?}{\geq}\left(\begin{array}{c} \text{no control over confounds}\\\text{representative population}\end{array}\right)$$



The best case for generalizing results is if there are 

- [consensus findings]{.large .purple .emph}

- from studies using [different designs]{.large .green .emph}

- across [different populations]{.large .blue .emph}

- by different research groups.

## Interaction Interpretation

Misconception: Lack of statistical interaction => lack of real-world interaction

- Statistical interaction effects are conditional on the specific model and data

- Model lack of fit => interaction may not be significant even if real-world effect exists

- Data collected over wrong range? 


[All models are wrong, but some are useful -- George Box]{.emph .large}

## Significance Testing

!['Detector! What would the Bayesian statistician say if I asked him whether the--' [roll] 'I AM A NEUTRINO DETECTOR, NOT A LABYRINTH GUARD. SERIOUSLY, DID YOUR BRAIN FALL OUT?' [roll] '... yes.'](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/frequentists_vs_bayesians.png)

[The null is MUCH MORE LIKELY  than the alternative!]{.emph .huge .green .fragment}

## Significance Testing

- Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) is a combination of two distinct testing philosophies [(More Reading)](https://bookdown.org/csu_statistics/inferential_reasoning_in_data_analysis/Estimation-vs-testing.html)

- It is often more important is to understand the [size of the effect]{.cerulean .emph .large}

- Confidence intervals provide both effect size and precision!
    - (and don't have to be reduced to is the null value in here?)
