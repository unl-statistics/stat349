The audience says 'Ooh!' and 'It must be true because it's pie'. The presenter thinks 'That worked too well' as offscreen text says 'I pledge my life and my fortune to the pie!'."}

The presenter says 'That concludes my two-hour presentation. Any questions?'. The manager says 'Did you intend the presentation to be incomprehensible, or do you have some sort of rare power-point disability?' The presenter replies 'Are there any questions about the content?'. Offscreen, someone says 'There was content?'"}

## Timing & Delivery

- Practice ahead of time
    - Don't read from slides or a script
    - Fill the allotted time ... but don't go over

Two audience members are asleep, and the third appears to claw their eyes out while screaming 'GAAAAH!'. The final frame has everyone looking at a pair of feet, as if the audience member fell over in their chair, while one of the onlookers says 'Powerpoint poisoning'."}

    
## Timing & Delivery

- Space visuals to maintain attention
    - but visuals should be relevant
    


- Volume (use a mic if you need to)
- Posture/nonverbals matter too!
    - Dress appropriately

- Limit filler words and control physical/verbal tics
