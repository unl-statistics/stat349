## Function

- Turn data into knowledge

- How do your results inform the research question you identified?

- How does that research question fit into the discipline?

- What comes next?


## Informing the Research Question

- Goal: Claim the strongest and broadest interpretation you can argue

- Within scientific constraints!

- You can speculate about possible interpretations -- what results might mean

  - be cautious
  - this is a way to identify future research
  
- "Hedges" are common to avoid overstating
    - "likely", "suggest", "an alternative interpretation", etc.

## Writing Order

Most people find that it's easier to write in this order: 

- Methods
- Results
- Discussion
- Introduction

This allows you to make the Introduction a mirror/inversion of the Discussion

## Interpret Results

- 1st paragraph of the Discussion

- Restate the most important results briefly

- Comment on whether results were expected or not
  - Use this to tie in literature
  
## Consider Limitations

- Statistical power
- Sampling and generalizing to a target population
- Limitations of data (collection, source, measurement method, ...)
- Alternative explanations

Use the opportunity to argue why this limitation isn't a big deal, if possible.

In a business report, you may want to use this section to identify situations where your results may no longer hold -- market shifts, pending legislation, etc.

## Relate to Bigger Picture

- Fit your answer into broader contexts

- Identify areas of consensus and/or disagreement

- What new questions arise?

- How does the problem relate to other problems in the research area or facing the company?

## Future Work

- Specific case -> more general case?

- New hypotheses?

- Different methods which may yield more interesting results?


## Activity

- Look at your IgNobel article Discussion

  - Highlight "hedge" words/phrases

  - What limitations are discussed? Separate out:
    - limitation statements
    - statements to minimize the limitation
    - statements that mitigate the limitation
  
  - How is the last "thought" in the Discussion supported by the rest of the section?
