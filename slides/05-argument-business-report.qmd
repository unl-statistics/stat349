# Argument & Rhetoric in Technical Writing

## Arguments

Fundamentally an argument is a **claim** backed up by **evidence**

Supporting information:

- definitions
- citations to authority or past work
- data (& models & charts)


## Counter-arguments

Powerful approach: anticipate and address counter-arguments as part of your argument.

Strategies:

- Argue against the counter argument directly
- Accept the counter argument's premise, but claim ___ matters more
- Reject the premise of the counter argument and explain why the premise is faulty

It's important (in most circumstances) to treat opposing viewpoints fairly

## Audience

All arguments are made to a specific audience.

Anticipate your audience's concerns and what arguments are likely to be most effective at addressing those concerns.

## Reading Critically

Every source you use is also making an argument

- Understand the author's perspective/background
- Don't consider anyone the ultimate authority
- Identify potential sources of bias
- Consider the audience the author is addressing - is it the same as your audience?

## Practice

Let's listen to an argument about declining attention.

Take notes - how is the author making the argument?

Why or why not?
